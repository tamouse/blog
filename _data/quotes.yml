    Control is an illusion. Giving in to chaos is the only way
    through. You don't surf by telling the waves what to do.

  title: Criticizing Taste
  cite: Ray Bradbury
  text: |
    I have never listened to anyone who criticized my taste in space
    travel, sideshows or gorillas. When this occurs, I pack up my
    dinosaurs and leave the room.

  title: We expect something better from the political left

  text: |
    Every nation-state tends towards the imperial -- that is the
    point. Through banks, armies, secret police, propaganda, courts
    and jails, treaties, taxes, laws and orders, myths of civil
    obedience, assumptions of civic virtue at the top. Still it should
    be said of the political left, we expect something better. And
    correctly. We put more trust in those who show a measure of
    compassion, who denouÂ­nce the hideous social arrangements that
    make war inevitable and human desire omnipresent; which fosters
    corporate selfishness, panders to appetites and disorder, waste
    the earth.

  text: |
    Everyone is fighting their own battles to be free from the past,
    live in their present, and to create a future for themselves.

    So have heart.

  title: The World is Rated R

  text: |
    The world is rated R, and no one is checking IDs. Do not try to
    make it G by imagining the shadows away. Do not try to hide your
    children from the world forever, but do not try to pretend there
    is no danger. Train them. Give them sharp eyes and bellies full of
    laughter. Make them dangerous. Make them yeast, and when they've
    grown, they will pollute the shadows.

    Let us plunge together down the dangerous path of surrender. It
    may be dangerous, but it is the only path worth following.

    Let us forget all that we are taught about how it is nobel to give
    and humiliating to receive. Because for most people, generosity
    consists only of giving, but receiving is also an act of love.

    Allowing someone else to be happy will make them happy too.

    When our days become dreary with low-hovering clouds of despair,
    and when our nights become darker than a thousand midnights, let us
    remember that there is a creative force in this universe, working to
    pull down the gigantic mountains of evil, a power that is able to make
    a way out of no way and transform dark yesterdays into bright
    tomorrows. Let us realize that the arc of the moral universe is long
    but it bends toward justice.

    virtuous, can be accomplished alone; therefore we are saved by
    love. No virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of
    our friends or foes as it is from our standpoint. Therefore we must
    be saved by the final form of love which is forgiveness.

    I am not worried if scientists go and explain everything. This is
    for a very simple reason: an impala sprinting across the Savannah
    can be reduced to biomechanics, and Bach can be reduced to
    counterpoint, yet that does not decrease one iota our ability to
    shiver as we experience impalas leaping or Bach thundering. We can
    only gain and grow with each discovery that there is structure
    underlying the most accessible levels of things that fill us with
    awe.

    But there is an even stronger reason why I am not afraid that
    scientists will inadvertently go and explain everything--it will
    never happen. While in certain realms, it may prove to be the case
    that science can explain anything, it will never explain
    everything. As should be obvious after all these pages, as part of
    the scientific process, for every question answered, a dozen newer
    ones are generated. And they are usually far more puzzling, more
    challenging than than the prior problems. This was stated
    wonderfully in a quote by a geneticist named Haldane earlier in the
    century: "Life is not only stranger than we imagine, it is stranger
    than we can imagine." We will never have our flames extinguished by
    knowledge. The purpose of science is not to cure us of our sense of
    mystery and wonder, but to constantly reinvent and reinvigorate it.

    prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a
    positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly
    says: "I agree with the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with
    your methods of direct action"; <strong>who paternalistically
    believes he can set the timetable for another man's
    freedom</strong>; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who
    constantly advises the Negro to wait for a "more convenient

    more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill
    will</strong>. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than

pale_blue_dot:

  text: |
    From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any
    particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again
    that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you
    love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human
    being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our
    joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies,
    and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and
    coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king
    and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father,
    hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals,
    every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme
    leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species
    lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

    The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of
    the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so
    that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters
    of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by
    the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely
    distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner. How frequent
    their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another,
    how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined
    self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged
    position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale
    light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic
    dark. In our obscurity – in all this vastness – there is no hint
    that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

    The Earth is the only world known, so far, to harbor life. There
    is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species
    could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for
    the moment, the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said
    that astronomy is a humbling and character-building
    experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly
    of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To
    me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one
    another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only
    home we've ever known.

kids_scientific_questions:

    Many adults are put off when youngsters pose scientific
    questions. Children ask why the sun is yellow, or what a dream is,
    or how deep you can dig a hole, or when is the world's birthday,
    or why we have toes.

    Too many teachers and parents answer with irritation or ridicule, or
    quickly move on to something else. Why adults should pretend to
    omniscience before a five-year-old, I can't for the life of me
    understand. What's wrong with admitting that you don't know?
    Children soon recognize that somehow this kind of question annoys
    many adults. A few more experiences like this, and another child has
    been lost to science.

    There are many better responses. If we have an idea of the answer,
    we could try to explain. If we don't, we could go to the
    encyclopedia or the library. Or we might say to the child: "I don't
    know the answer. Maybe no one knows. Maybe when you grow up, you'll
    be the first to find out."

why_did_god_create_atheists:
  cite: "Tales of Hasidim, Vol. 2 by Martin Buber"
  text: |
    There is a famous story told in Chassidic literature that
    addresses this very question.

    The Master teaches the student that God created everything in the
    world to be appreciated, since everything is here to teach us a
    lesson.

    One clever student asks "What lesson can we learn from atheists?
    Why did God create them?"

    The Master responds, "God created atheists to teach us the most
    important lesson of them all -- the lesson of true compassion. You
    see, when an ahteist performs an act of charity, visits someone
    who is sick, helps someone in need, and cares for the world, he is
    not doing so because of some religious teaching. He does not
    believe that God commanded him to perform this act. In fact, he
    does not believe in God at all, so his acts are based on an inner
    sense of morality. And look at the kindness he can bestow upon
    others simply because he feels it to be right."

    "This means," the Master continued, "That when someone reaches out
    to you for help, you should never say 'I pray that God will help
    you.' Instead for the moment, you should become an atheist,
    imagine that there is no God who can help and say 'I will help you.'"

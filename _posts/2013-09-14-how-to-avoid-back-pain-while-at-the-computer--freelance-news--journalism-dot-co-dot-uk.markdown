A pretty decent article that I should pay much more attention to.

> Most hacks spend a good chunk of their working life hunched over the
> computer pounding away at the keyboard trying to beat those
> ever-pressing deadlines.
> 
> For them, as for a good proportion of the working world, back pain
> caused by poor working conditions can be a real problem.
> 
> Here Nicola Tann - formerly a body-conditioning instructor and
> professional dancer and now a freelance journalist - sets out some
> simple but effective tips on how stay pain-free at the desk.
> 
> ## Set up
> 
> Having a comfortable place to work makes a huge difference. If you are
> squashed into the corner of a bedroom, your desk is cluttered, or your
> lighting is insufficient, you will respond physically - by hunching up
> or leaning forward to peer at your screen.
> 
> ### Make sure:
> 
> * Your chair is comfortable and at a height where you can rest both
> feet flat on the floor.
> * Your keyboard is far enough forward on your work surface so that
> you can rest your forearms, from elbow to wrist, on the desk. This
> relaxes the shoulders, helping to prevent tension and possible nerve
> irritation. 
> * Your chair, desk and monitor are all at the correct height to work
> comfortably and you have adequate light.
> * You use a separate keyboard if you work on a laptop. 
> 
> ## Sit up
> 
> Many of us, when we imagine we are sitting up straight, can in fact
> over-compensate for our normal postural problems. If, for example, we
> usually have rounded shoulders, when told to sit up straight we may pull
> them too far back. In many cases this will throw the lower spine out of
> alignment too. Here are a few tips to help you to find a straight spine.
> (If you start to tense up during the following steps, take a few moments
> to breathe into the tense area and relax - the spine should feel able to
> move, not set in concrete.)
> 
> * Sitting with both feet flat on the floor, feel the two 'sitting
> bones' in the buttocks taking equal weight. 
> * Now start to feel the back of your skull becoming buoyant and
> gently pulling up away from your 'sitting bones'. (The top of the head
> is actually close to the crown, far further back than you might imagine,
> so the chin will drop down slightly as the back of the neck lengthens.)
> * As the two ends of the spine lengthen away from each other, gently
> pull the belly button in toward the spine for support, keeping the ribs
> relaxed. (If you find this hard to feel, use an out-breath to pull in.)
> * Finally, let your shoulders slide down away from your ears. To help
> broaden the shoulders imagine someone gently pulling them away from each
> other. Tip: Shoulders should feel broad across the front and the back at
> the same time. 
> 
> ## Counter attack
> 
> The simplest rule to follow is: 'do the opposite movement to the one
> that is causing the problem'. If your screen is to your right, move it
> to the left. Swap your mouse to the other hand - you will get used to it
> much quicker than you think. This can be applied beyond just working
> practice - sleep on your other side, carry your bag on the other
> shoulder, hold your phone in the other hand. Here are some gentle
> stretches on this premise that can be done either at or by your desk.
> Repeat each a few times. Sit up straight and:
> 
> * Circle the shoulders up, back, down then forward. There are three
> shoulder circles - one with the arms hanging down, one circling the
> elbows with each hand on its own shoulder, and the third circling the
> whole extended arm - that work every muscle in and around the shoulder
> joint.
> * Sitting with your hands in your lap, pull your shoulders up to your
> ears and hold for a few seconds before letting them relax down. 
> * Gently move your head, making sure you return to upright between
> each stretch. Drop your ear toward your shoulder on each side. Look left
> and right, and up and down - when looking up be careful not to 'crunch'
> into the vertebrae, but to extend, keeping some length in the back of
> the neck.
> 
> ## Move it
> 
> Walking is, after lying horizontal, the activity that puts the least
> pressure on the spine, (with standing coming third and sitting the worst
> of the four), but any gentle movement is good if it's raining or your
> flat/office is too small for a good walk.
> 
> Try every hour or 90 minutes to get up from your desk and move around -
> even if it's only for a few minutes. Here are some suggestions: 
> 
> * Go round the block/ to the park/ for a paper if it's a nice day. As
> you walk let your shoulders drop away from your ears and your arms swing
> naturally by your side - this will relax the shoulders, helping prevent
> possible nerve irritation, and naturally stimulate lymph drainage - a
> process that can become sluggish if inactive for long periods.
> * If you work in an office, go to talk to a colleague rather than
> emailing them or picking up the phone - and try to leave the office for
> some fresh air daily.
> * If you work at home there is a lot you can do. Wander round the
> garden, or put on your favourite song and dance and sing/shout-along. It
> may sound silly, but singing engages the diaphragm and this in turn
> encourages deeper breathing, naturally dispelling tension. 
> 
> ## Relax
> 
> Neck and shoulders - lie on the floor with your arms out to the side,
> palms facing up, feet propped on the floor, hip width apart with knees
> pointing up to the ceiling. Breathe naturally into your belly, feeling
> your whole body relax into the floor.
> 
> As you breathe allow the shoulders to relax, feeling the front of the
> armpit opening up. Then feel the weight of the head sinking down into
> the floor. Gently roll the head from side to side over the back of the
> skull, (keeping your chin slightly tucked down), as if your head were
> full of sand, and you were pouring it from each ear. Continue to breathe
> steadily and deeply.
> 
> Lower back - kneel, sitting back on your feet, with the knees slightly
> apart. Lean forward to rest over your thighs and rest your arms along
> the floor either out in front of you or back by your legs - whichever is
> more comfortable. Let your head relax forward and rest here for as long
> as you need, breathing deeply and, again, allowing the whole body to
> relax toward the floor. Tip - let the 'crease' in the front of the hip
> deepen and get softer as you relax.
> 
> ## Treatment
> 
> Physiotherapy, osteopathy, chiropractics, massage and acupuncture can
> all provide relief, and should be viewed as a business expense. When you
> find the right treatment and practitioner, you will wonder how you ever
> did without them. Getting timely treatment can not only relieve pain,
> but also prevent future problems.
> 
> Try getting a recommendation for a practitioner from someone you know
> or, if this fails, check how long a therapist has been practicing and if
> they have any experience in dealing with your particular problem. Most
> practitioners will be happy to have a chat before you book in with them,
> even if it is only over the phone, and if they're not willing then they
> may not be worth seeing.
> 
> ## Instruction
> 
> If you feel any pain or discomfort during any of the above exercises,
> stop immediately. Going to a pilates or body conditioning class will
> give you the benefit of advice from the instructor, who is trained to
> correct you on observation. Always arrive a little early to let the
> instructor know about any problems or pain you may have and they will be
> able to tailor their instructions to your needs.

Alaska warmer than the southern 48 United States.

> While the continental U.S. shivered through an abnormally [cold spell](http://www.climatecentral.org/news/arctic-blast-has-half-the-lower-48-states-in-its-grip-16796) in December 2013, Alaska experienced record-breaking heat. Both extremes were caused by an unusual kink in the northern hemisphere's [polar jet stream,](http://www.nc-climate.ncsu.edu/secc_edu/images/jet_streams_Polar&Sub.jpg) which caused frigid Arctic air to move south and warm air to head north.
> 
> The [jet stream](http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Jet_stream) is a fast-moving belt of westerly winds created by the convergence of cold air masses from the Arctic and warm air from lower latitudes. It's common for it to have meanders called [Rossby waves,](http://www.geography.hunter.cuny.edu/tbw/wc.notes/7.circ.atm/rossby_waves.htm) but what was unusual in December 2013 was how amplified and contorted those waves became after a [ridge](http://www.theweatherprediction.com/habyhints2/457/) of high pressure parked itself over Alaska.

> As warm air pushed north, numerous temperature records fell in Alaska. On December 7, 2013, temperatures reached 39°F (4°C) at [Deadhorse,](http://goo.gl/maps/neJ3K) an airport in far northern Alaska that serves Prudhoe Bay. This was the warmest December temperature measured there since the airport was established in 1968, [according](http://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/comment.html?entrynum=222) to Weather Underground historian Christopher Burt. Meanwhile, high temperature records for December also fell or were tied at [Barter Island, Alaska,](http://goo.gl/maps/LcNGU) and [Wainwright, Alaska.](http://goo.gl/maps/mRY4Y) In contrast, many towns in the Pacific Northwest saw [record cold](http://portlandtribune.com/pt/9-news/203744-record-cold-arrives-and-could-continue) temperatures.

> This map of land surface temperature anomalies for December 3–10, 2013, shows the sharp contrast between Alaska and the western U.S. Based on data from the [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer](http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/) (MODIS) on NASA's [Terra](http://terra.nasa.gov) satellite, the map depicts 2013 temperatures compared to the 2001–2010 average for the same eight day period.

> Areas with warmer than average temperatures are shown in red; near-normal temperatures are white; and areas that were cooler than the 2000-2011 base period are blue. Note that [Land surface temperatures](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/GlobalMaps/view.php?d1=MOD11C1_M_LSTDA) (LST) are distinct from the air temperatures that meteorological stations typically measure. LSTs indicate how hot the surface of the Earth would feel [to the touch.](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/HottestSpot/page2.php) From a satellite vantage point, the “surface” includes a number of materials that capture and retain heat, such as desert sand, the dark roof of a building, or the pavement of a road. As a result, daytime land surface temperatures are usually higher than air temperatures.

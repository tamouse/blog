> The photo at top shows a spectacular 360 degree
[fogbow](http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/fogbow.htm), a 360 degree
solar [glory](http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/glory.htm) and the
[Spectre of the
Brocken](http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/globrock.htm) as viewed from
the [Golden Gate Bridge](http://goldengatebridge.org/research/facts.php)
in [San Francisco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco),
California. In order to see such a display the
[fog](http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/clouds.htm) layer needs to be
below the observer and [the
Sun](http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Sun) should
be positioned above him or her. [Golden Gate
Strait](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate) and Golden Gate Bay
are both well known for their fog and are one of the best places in the
world to see fog-related optical phenomena. Still, seeing the 360 degree
fogbow, replete with a spectre shadow and glory, is a rare treat.

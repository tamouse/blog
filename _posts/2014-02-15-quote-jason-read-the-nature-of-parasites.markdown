> # "People who dismiss the unemployed and dependent as 'parasites' fail to understand economics and parasitism.
> &mdash; Jason Read

Continuing:

> A successful parasite is one that is not recognized by its host, one that can make its host work for it without appearing as a burden. Such is the ruling class in a capitalist society."

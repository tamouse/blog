excerpt: This is the story she wanted to tell. Feather, paint, and one shining eye, smudges on her cheeks made with a fingertip.

> photo by @randyolson | words by @neilshea13 — This is the story she
> wanted to tell. Feather, paint, and one shining eye, smudges on her
> cheeks made with a fingertip. She came into the center of the
> village and presented herself to the camera. Many others had the
> ingredients but only she made this. She sat calmly for the portrait
> and spoke only her name, which is now lost. In the years since, we
> have wondered about the meaning of this photograph. There is a
> temptation to pile a lot in, for much has changed on the Omo and
> there are at least two girls here. One you see. To find the other
> you must unmake the image. Ask her to remove the feather. Then the
> paint. Then go back to before we arrived, before the boys tugged on
> third-hand Playboy t-shirts and the girls, when they heard us
> coming, slipped in lip plates and smeared clay onto their faces. Go
> back before breakfast and dawn and roosters. Keep going. Return
> upriver to camp. Return overland to the capital. Bury the roads on
> your way, dismantle the plantations. Fire all the policemen and
> gather up their guns. Shut down the Coca-Cola plant. Drive out
> missionaries. Unbuild the dam that turns water into a question, and
> level the government villages where no one wants to live. Keep going
> until things look right. Keep leaving. At the first hotel, many
> miles north, the clerk will greet you with a smile. “You are covered
> with dust,” he’ll say. “Sometimes that is life.” Yes, sometimes. And
> somewhere back behind you is the second girl, the one who appears on
> most days, when life holds few reasons for paint or feathers. She is
> tending goats, or looking at the moon. Possibly she is quite happy.

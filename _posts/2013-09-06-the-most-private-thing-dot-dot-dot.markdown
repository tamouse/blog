> # Probably one of the most private things in the world is an egg before it is broken. 
>> &mdash; [M.F.K. Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M_F_K_Fisher)

M.F.K. Fisher is one of the goddesses of the food world. Having passed
in 1992, her legacy lives on quite strongly, in writing, in the food
world, and in American literature.

Privacy is something we have in short supply, it seems (or at least, I
seem to). Yet the notion of the egg unbroken still appeals to me a
lot, as it feels like this to me, that no one really knows me until I
break, that it is in the breaking my most private secrets are revealed
and I am completely vulnerable.

I can remake my shells, unlike the poor egg; once broken, into the
omelet it goes. My scramble, on the otherhand, seems to be able to be
crammed back inside. While still mixed up, I can appear smooth,
eternal, round.

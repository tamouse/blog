> ## Explanation:

> [As the Moon](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141009.html)
rose and the Sun set on October 8, a lunar eclipse was in progress seen
from [Chongqing, China](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090724.html).
Trailing through [this composite time exposure](https://www.flickr.com/photos/zhouyannan/15480280245/), the
rising Moon began as a dark reddened disk in total eclipse near the
eastern horizon. Steadily climbing above the populous city's colorful
[lights](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130411.html) along the Yangtze
River, the moontrail grows brighter and broader, until a bright Full
Moon emerged from the Earth's shadow in evening skies. Although lunar
eclipses are not always total ones, this eclipse, along with [last
April's](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140428.html) lunar eclipse, were
the first two of four *consecutive* total lunar eclipses, a [series
known as a tetrad.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gzgSuJM5O8) The
final two eclipses of this tetrad will occur in early April and late
September 2015.

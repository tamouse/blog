> **Explanation:**
> [Fifty years ago](http://www.nasa.gov/feature/stepping-into-the-void),
> on June 3, 1965, Edward White stepped out of the orbiting Gemini 4
> spacecraft to become the first US astronaut
> [to walk in space](http://www.nasa.gov/feature/gemini-iv-learning-to-walk-in-space).
> White is captured in
> [this photo taken](http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1098.html)
> by mission commander James McDivit from inside the capsule as White's
> spacewalk began over the Pacific Ocean on
> [Gemini 4's third orbit](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4203/%0Ach11-2.htm).
> Planet Earth, spacecraft, and tether are reflected in White's gold
> tinted helmet visor. A gas powered manuevering gun is held in his
> right hand. Though the gun ran out of gas after only 3 minutes, he
> continued to manuever by twisting his body and pulling on the tether
> for the remainder of the 23 minute long
> [Extra Vehicular Activity](http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/%0Aoutside-the-spacecraft/online/).
> White later described his
> [historic spacewalk](http://www.nasa.gov/celebrating-50-years-of-american-spacewalks)
> as the most comfortable part of the mission, and said the order to end
> it was the "saddest moment"
> [of his life](http://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/).

> and
> [Sheveluch](http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/oldroot/volcanoes/sheveluch/sheveluch.html).
> The former erupted for the first time in three years. During its
> strongest eruptive phase (shown above),
> [lava fountains](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/10/lava-fountains-and-lava-flows-from-russias-kliuchevskoi/)

> be heard at a distance of 19 mi (30 km) away. Note the funnel shaped
> cloud of steam and smoke above Klyuchevskoy's concealed, 
> [volcanic cone](http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/volcanic-cone/?ar_a=1).

[Quote for the day](https://www.facebook.com/Punkmom/posts/10204652297098864), from [Kaye Luck](https://www.facebook.com/Punkmom):  
"Science is not meant to cure us of mystery, but reinvent and reinvigorate it"  
-- Robert Sapolsky


## Full quote, via [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/187.Robert_M_Sapolsky)

> I am not worried if scientists go and explain everything. This is
  for a very simple reason: an impala sprinting across the Savannah
  can be reduced to biomechanics, and Bach can be reduced to
  counterpoint, yet that does not decrease one iota our ability to
  shiver as we experience impalas leaping or Bach thundering. We can
  only gain and grow with each discovery that there is structure
  underlying the most accessible levels of things that fill us with
  awe.

> "But there is an even stronger reason why I am not afraid that
  scientists will inadvertently go and explain everything--it will
  never happen. While in certain realms, it may prove to be the case
  that science can explain anything, it will never explain
  everything. As should be obvious after all these pages, as part of
  the scientific process, for every question answered, a dozen newer
  ones are generated. And they are usually far more puzzling, more
  challenging than than the prior problems. This was stated
  wonderfully in a quote by a geneticist named Haldane earlier in the
  century: "Life is not only stranger than we imagine, it is stranger
  than we can imagine." We will never have our flames extinguished by
  knowledge. The purpose of science is not to cure us of our sense of
  mystery and wonder, but to constantly reinvent and reinvigorate it."

Let me repeat part of that:

# "We will never have our flames extinguished by knowledge"

Knowledge is not what puts out our fire, it is what **fuels** our fire. Answers that cease or stop further inquiry are not knowledge; they are camouflage, salves, blinders, and propaganda to make us silent and to curtail learning and seeking. Accept nothing, question everything, including *this*.

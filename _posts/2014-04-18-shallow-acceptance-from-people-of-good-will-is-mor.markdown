> # First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate.
> &mdash; Martin Luther King, Jr., "Letter from Birmingham Jail", Why We Can't Wait (1963)

Continuing:

> I have almost reached
  the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in
  his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or
  the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to
  "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the
  absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of
  justice; who constantly says: "I agree with the goal you seek, but I
  cannot agree with your methods of direct action"; <strong>who
  paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another
  man's freedom</strong>; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who
  constantly advises the Negro to wait for a "more convenient
  season". <strong>Shallow understanding from people of good will is more
  frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill
  will</strong>. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright
  rejection.

Of course, Dr. King's words address the plight of not just Black
Americans, but all oppressed groups by the hegemonic majority. It is
bloody easy to give lip service to ideas that you believe in, without
having any stake in the struggle. Lend your hearts, lend your hands,
lend your words to the right ears, your writing to the right eyes.

We have before us today many struggles for equality, and continuing
the struggle for justice, true *social* justice, not just the sort our
system metes out as an expression of our baser bloodlust and desire
for retribution.

And those who could help, looking on, snarking from the sidelines
about "Oh, I wouldn't do it that way" and yet never do it their way at
all. "The time isn't right."

As a member of the entrenched hegemonic majority, much is blind to me,
I don't know when I'm being oppressive; I can recognize oppression,
but not all of it. It isn't guilt or shame that motivates me,
however. I'm not guilty that I've been born to and lived a highly
privileged life. I do not wish to trade on that privilege at the cost
of oppressing someone else, though.

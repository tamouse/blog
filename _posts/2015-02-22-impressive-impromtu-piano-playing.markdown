Henri Herbert, keyboard player with the Jim Jones Revue (a high octane
rock and roll band from London), gives an impromptu performance on the
concourse of St Pancras International station, London.

The piano he is playing in this clip is one of several that were
placed around railway station concourses in London last summer, for
any member of the public to play. Henri decided he would give an
impromptu performance to help promote an upcoming boogie woogie
festival.

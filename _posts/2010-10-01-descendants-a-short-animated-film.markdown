I just watched one of the most gorgeous CG animated films of all time.

*Descendants* is a story about a flower that falls in love
with a deer. There is a villain in the story voiced sumptuously by
Whoopie Goldberg. The story is a variation on the theme "a bird may love
a fish, but where will they live?" The ending is a bit ambiguous, but
still pretty wonderful. Note that the movie embeds in an iframe, may not
work on all browsers.

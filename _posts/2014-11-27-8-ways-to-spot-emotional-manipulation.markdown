Tumblr post from [Consciously Contradictory] on looking for people who are engaging in emotional manipulation.

## Summary of Rules:

1. When dealing with an emotional blackmailer TRUST your gut. TRUST your senses. Once an emotional manipulator finds a successful maneuver - it’s added to their hit list and you’ll be fed a steady diet of this shit.

2. When an emotional manipulator says "yes", make them accountable for it. Do not buy into the sighs and subtleties. If they don’t want to do it, make them tell you [so] up front.

3. Saying one thing and later assuring you they did not say it.

4. Guilt. Emotional manipulators are excellent guilt mongers.

5. Emotional manipulators fight dirty. They don’t deal with things directly.

6. One-ups-manship -- if you have a headache, they have a brain tumour.  No matter what your situation is, the emotional manipulator has been (or is) there, but ten times worse.

7. Emotional manipulators have the ability to impact the emotional [state] of those around them.

8. Emotional manipulators have no sense of accountability

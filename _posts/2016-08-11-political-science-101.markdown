> ## Political Science 101

> The House of Representatives controls the government checkbook, not
> the president. His only authority on the budget is to sign on the
> dotted line that was written by your elected
> representatives. Pissed off about the debt? Pissed off about the
> deficit? Then blame congress. Want something to finally get done?
> Then vote out the House Republicans who sign away your hard-earned
> tax dollars to subsidize multi-billion-dollar corporations -- many
> of whom don't pay any income tax at all. Wake up. Learn how your
> government works and do something about it!

Attributed to Molly Gum of the Blue Street Journal, but I can find no
information through my google-fu.

This appears next to an image of Bob Dole, former US Senator, as if
it's attributed to him.

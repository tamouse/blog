> 
> ## 1. Ocean Detected Inside Enceladus
> 
> * NASA's Cassini spacecraft and Deep Space Network provided the first
> geophysical measurements of the internal structure of Enceladus,
> consistent with the existence of a hidden ocean inside the moon.
> * Gravity measurements suggest a large, possibly regional, ocean about
> 6 miles (10 kilometers) deep, beneath an ice shell about 19 to 25 miles
> (30 to 40 kilometers) thick.
> * Flyby data yielded evidence of a zone inside the southern end of the
> moon with higher density than other portions of the interior.
> * Surface fractures, known as “tiger stripes,” may lead down to a part
> of the moon that is tidally heated by the moon's repeated flexing as
> Enceladus follows its eccentric orbit around Saturn.

> ## 2. 101 Geysers Identified on Enceladus
> 
> * Scientists have identified 101 distinct geysers erupting on Saturn's
> icy moon Enceladus. Their analysis suggests that it is possible for
> liquid water from the moon's underground sea to reach all the way to its
> surface.
> * Each geyser erupts from one of the tiger stripe fractures and is
> coincident with small hot spots.
> * The greatest geyser activity coincides with the greatest thermal
> radiation. Comparisons between the geysers and tidal stresses reveal
> similar connections.
> * Opening and closing of the fractures allow water vapor from below to
> reach the surface.
> * Condensation on the surface produces the hot spots.

> 
> ## 3. Possible Birth of a Saturn Moon
> 
> * Cassini has documented the formation of a small icy object within the
> rings of Saturn that may be a new moon, and may also provide clues to
> the formation of the planet's known moons.
> * Disturbances at the very edge of Saturn's A ring -- the outermost of
> the planet's large, bright rings -- are about 20 percent brighter than
> their surroundings, measuring 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) long and 6
> miles (10 kilometers) wide, the feature may be caused by the
> gravitational effects of a nearby object.
> * Not expected to grow any larger (and maybe even be falling apart) the
> formation and outward movement of the object aids in our understanding
> of how Saturn's icy moons may have formed in more massive rings long
> ago. It also provides insight into how Earth and other planets in our
> solar system may have formed and migrated away from the sun.
> * The object, informally named Peggy, is too small to be seen in images
> so far, but is probably no more than about a half mile (about a
> kilometer) in diameter.

> 
> The disturbance visible at the outer edge of Saturn's A ring in this
> image from Cassini could be caused by an object replaying the birth
> process of icy moons.

> 
> ## 4. Sunny Seas and Clouds Spotted on Titan
> 
> * Cassini has captured, for the first time, simultaneous views of both
> the polar hydrocarbon seas and the sun glinting off one of the seas.
> * A bright margin around Kraken Mare -- the sea containing the
> reflected sunglint -- indicates that the sea was larger at some point,
> but evaporation has decreased its size.
> * Since a huge storm swept across the icy moon's low latitudes in late
> 2010, only a few small clouds have been observed anywhere on the icy
> moon. The lack of cloud activity has surprised researchers.
> * Recent images of clouds moving across the northern hydrocarbon seas
> of Saturn's moon Titan have been obtained. This renewed weather
> activity, considered overdue by researchers, could finally signal the
> onset of summer storms that atmospheric models have long predicted.

> ## 5. Hyperion's Electrostatically Charged Surface
> 
> * During a 2005 flyby of Saturn's moon Hyperion, the spacecraft was
> briefly bathed in a beam of electrons coming from the moon's
> electrostatically charged surface.
> * Static electricity is known to play an important role on our own
> dusty moon, but evidence of static charge building up on other objects
> in the solar system has been elusive until now.
> * Hyperion is porous and icy, with a bizarre, sponge-like appearance.
> Its surface is continuously bombarded by ultraviolet light from the sun
> and exposed to a rain of electrons and ions within the invisible bubble
> generated by Saturn’s magnetic field. Researchers think Hyperion's
> exposure to this hostile space environment is the source of the particle
> beam that struck Cassini.
> * Surface features observed on the asteroid Eros and several of
> Saturn's moons might be due to the motion of charged dust across their
> surfaces.

> 
> ## 6. 'Magic Island' Evolves in Titan Sea
> 
> * A mysterious feature, dubbed the “Magic Island” has been monitored in
> one of Titan’s large hydrocarbon seas. The feature covers an area of
> about 100 square miles (260 square kilometers) in Ligeia Mare.
> * The feature, which appears bright in radar images against the dark
> background of the liquid sea, was first spotted during Cassini's July
> 2013 Titan flyby. It has now been observed twice by Cassini's radar
> experiment, but its appearance changed between the two apparitions.
> * The feature could be surface waves, rising bubbles, floating solids,
> solids suspended just below the surface, or perhaps something more
> exotic.

> These three images, created from Cassini Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
> data, show the appearance and evolution of a mysterious feature in
> Ligeia Mare, one of the largest hydrocarbon seas on Saturn's moon Titan.

> ## 7. Mimas Hides Frozen Core or Ocean
> 
> * Even though Mimas' heavily cratered outward appearance does not
> suggest anything unusual lies beneath its surface, its interior either
> has a frozen core shaped something like a football or the satellite
> contains a liquid water ocean.
> * Observations of how much the moon wobbles as it orbits Saturn
> constrain models for how its interior might be arranged leading to two
> possibilities that fit the data.
> * If Mimas is hiding a liquid water ocean, it lies 15 to 20 miles (24
> to 31 kilometers) beneath the moon's impact-battered surface. At 246
> miles (396 kilometers) wide, Mimas is too small to have retained
> internal heat from its formation, so some other source of energy would
> be required to maintain an underground ocean.
>

> 
> This mosaic of Saturn's moon Mimas was created from images taken by
> Cassini during its closest flyby of the moon (Feb. 13, 2010).

> <a name="clumps"></a>
> 
> ## 8. Bright Clumps Diminish in the F Ring
> 
> * The number of exceptionally bright clumps of material in the F ring
> plummeted during the time between NASA’s Voyager mission and Cassini’s
> mission, a period of 30 years.
> * The diminishing number of bright clumps could be the result of a drop
> in the number of little moonlets between the Voyager and Cassini eras.
> * Saturn's moon Prometheus is the prime suspect for this behavior.
> Prometheus orbits just inside the F ring and stirs up the ring
> particles, sometimes leading to the creation of moonlets, and sometimes
> leading to their destruction.
> * Every 17 years, the orbit of Prometheus aligns with the orbit of the
> F ring in such a way that its influence is particularly strong spurring
> the creation of many new moonlets. The moonlets would then crash
> repeatedly through the F ring, eventually destroying them.

> <a name="salty"></a>
> 
> ## 9. Titan’s Salty Sea
> 
> * Cassini gravity data has provided firm evidence that the ocean inside
> Titan might be as salty as Earth's Dead Sea.
> * Findings support previous indications that the moon's icy shell is
> rigid and in the process of freezing solid. The thickness of the ice
> crust varies slightly from place to place, consistent with the ocean
> slowly crystalizing and turning to ice.
> * The ocean is probably an extremely salty brine of water mixed with
> dissolved salts likely composed of sulfur, sodium and potassium. The
> density indicated for this brine would give the ocean a salt content
> roughly equal to the saltiest bodies of water on Earth.
> * Outgassing of methane into Titan's atmosphere must happen at
> scattered "hot spots" as opposed to via convection or plate tectonics
> recycling of its ice shell.
> 
> ![Artist rendition of Titan](http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/files/Titan_OceanandIce_Main_1200w.jpg)
> 
> Researchers found that Titan's ice shell, which overlies a very salty
> ocean, varies in thickness around the moon, suggesting the crust is in
> the process of becoming rigid.

> <a name="auroras"></a>
> 
> ## 10. New Views of Saturn's Auroras
> 
> * Observations from multiple vantage points (e.g. Cassini orbiting
> Saturn and Hubble orbiting Earth) provided details on how the auroras
> move, showing the complexity of these auroras and how they connect to
> outbursts from the sun and their effect on Saturn’s magnetic
> environment.
> * One way that bright auroral storms may be produced is by the
> formation of new connections between magnetic field lines causing storms
> within Saturn’s magnetic bubble.
> * Mimas and Enceladus can influence Saturn’s light show as well.
> * Curtain-like auroras at Saturn, similar to those seen on Earth, are
> red at the bottom and purple at the top because they are dominated by
> emission from excited hydrogen molecules.
> 
> ![Saturn's Aurorae](http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/files/potw1420a_full.jpg)

> Astronomers using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope have captured new
> images of the dancing auroral lights at Saturn’s north pole.

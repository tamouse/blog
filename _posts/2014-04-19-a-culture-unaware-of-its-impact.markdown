Three things have come across my view this week that are all tied together:

1. [A quote by Martin Luther King, Jr on Shallow Acceptance](http://blog.tamouse.org/blog/2014/04/18/shallow-acceptance-from-people-of-good-will-is-mor/)
2. [A panel response by Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson on the influence of the hegemony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEeBPSvcNZQ#t=3690)
3. An essay on Medium about [Why girls cut themselves and why we can't blame tumblr](https://medium.com/editors-picks/7c792f3b9b07)

These are all interwoven into the same concept for me.

A *very* apt quote for our times, as it is in all times:

{% assign s3_path = site.images.s3path %}

{% include quote.html id=page.quote_id %}

*****

I cannot find an actual source for this quote. From [Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Dietrich_Bonhoeffer)'s [Misattributed](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Dietrich_Bonhoeffer#Misattributed) section:

> Attributed to Bonhoeffer on the Internet, and supposedly from
> [Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy (2010) by Eric Metaxas](http://books.google.com/books?id=aG0q3X8TVpsC&pg=PA486#v=onepage);
> however, there is no actual reference in that book. However, in
> advertising the book Metaxas does state on his site that the quote
> is from Bonhoeffer.

Even if the quote cannot be directly sourced to Bonhoffer, the source
of the quote is less imprtant than the actual words. Not acting is
still acting. I've heard that so many times from my old organizational
change teachers, Byron Fineman, Stan Rifkin, and many others. The
notion that we cannot ignore what is going on around us and never have
it affect us is reflected in the poem by Martin Neimoeller, a contemporary
of Bonhoffer:

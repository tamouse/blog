Enjoy them while you can. Only half the world's animals are left
compared with 40 years ago, mainly due to habitat destruction either
by locals for farming or by the multinational mineral and timber
trades.

The biennial Living Planet Report, released this week by the
conservation charity WWF, tracked the fate of 10,000 vertebrate
species around the world between 1970 and 2010. It found that the
total population of fish, birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles has
declined by 52 per cent in only two generations of humans.

Latin America saw the steepest decline, with animal populations
falling by 83 per cent. Animals living in fresh water also fared
badly, plummeting 76 per cent.

"The majority of species extintions and declines are being driven by
human pressures on the environment, both international and local,"
says Sam Turvey of the Institute of Biology at the Zoological Society
of London, who helps run a scheme to protect unusual species.

"It's a very challenging issue that requires a lot of effort and
attention with complex solutions, given that it's happening at a
global level," he says.

This pair is so gosh-darn cute, it's almost beyond expression, except "SQQQUUUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!"

[![Panda Twins at Zoo Atlanta](/images/critters/panda-twins.jpg "Panda Twins at Zoo Atlanta") ](http://www.zooborns.com/zooborns/2013/10/update-zoo-atlanta-panda.html "Zoo Atlanta Announces Names of Panda Twins")

Via [Zooborns.com](http://www.zooborns.com/zooborns/2013/10/update-zoo-atlanta-panda.html ) comes the following news:

> Zoo Atlanta's Panda twins are no longer 'Cub A' and 'Cub B'! On
  October 23, zoo officials announced the new names of their twin
  Panda cubs: Mei Lun ('may loon') and Mei Huan ('may hwaan'). The
  names originate from a Chinese idiom that means "something
  indescribably beautiful and magnificent." Following Chinese
  tradition, the names were announced on the same day the cubs turned
  100 days old.

Do jump to the site, there are many more pictures of the ever-so-cute pair.

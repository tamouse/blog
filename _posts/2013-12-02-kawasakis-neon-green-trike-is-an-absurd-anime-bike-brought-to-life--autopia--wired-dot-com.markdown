> We absolutely adore the wacky shit that comes out of Japan. But
> we're torn on the Kawasaki J concept. It's either inspired or
> idiotic. 

> A Monster Energy Drink-green half-breed of every anime bike you've
> ever seen, the J manages to make the future look both uncomfortable
> and absurd. And then adds a shark fin. There's a massive set of
> wheels out back that have been superglued together, and Kawasaki
> nixed the handlebars for a pair of levers attached to the two front
> wheels. Power? No idea. Kawasaki says it's electric and that the
> glowing tube mounted in the middle is a “Gigacell” battery of the
> nickel-metal hydride variety, but it may as well be a nuclear
> reactor frying the rider's manly bits. 

> The pseudo-cycle is too wide to split lanes and too spartan to carry
> anything more than a pack of gum, but its two-mode riding position
> is at least interesting. In speed mode, the J hunkers down to lay
> the rider into a sport bike position, while comfort mode raises the
> seat and dual handlebars into a more relaxing, urban cruiser
> setup. Still, aside from showing its engineering chops and proving
> that psychedelics are regularly passed around the Kawasaki design
> studio, we're at a loss with the J. And so is Kawasaki, which
> apparently couldn't even pick a cooler letter — let alone a full
> name — for this thing.

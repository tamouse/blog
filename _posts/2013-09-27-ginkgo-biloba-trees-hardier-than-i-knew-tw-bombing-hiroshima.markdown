A friend found this in the wikipedia article on the [Ginkgo Biloba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginkgo_biloba#Hiroshima).

# TRIGGER WORDS: Bombing, Hiroshima

> Extreme examples of the ginkgo's tenacity may be seen in Hiroshima,
  Japan, where six trees growing between 1â€“2 km from the 1945 atom
  bomb explosion were among the few living things in the area to
  survive the blast.[33] While almost all other plants (and animals)
  in the area were destroyed, the ginkgos, though charred, survived
  and were soon healthy again. The trees are alive to this day.

There is something fearsome about nature, and that even the most
destructive force unleashed by humans in an instant has not the power
to stop it.

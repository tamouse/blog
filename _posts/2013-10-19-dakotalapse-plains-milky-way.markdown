Randy Halverson of [DakotaLapse](http://dakotalapse.com) re-edited
previous footage from May of 2011 into a new time-lapse movie,
["Plains Milky Way"](http://vimeo.com/24551969) (embedded after the jump).

**(This is really fabulous in HD and Full-screen, with the sound turned way up!)**

## Randy's notes:

> During the month of May, I shot Milky Way timelapse in central South
  Dakota, when I had the time, and the weather cooperated. The biggest
  challenge was cloudy nights and the wind. There were very few
  nights, when I could shoot, that were perfectly clear, and often the
  wind was blowing 25mph +. That made it hard to get the shots I
  wanted. I kept most of the shots low to the ground, so the wind
  wouldn't catch the setup and cause camera shake, or blow it over. I
  used a Stage Zero Dolly on the dolly shots and a "Milapse" mount on
  the panning ones.

> This was all shot at night. If you see stars and it looks like
  daylight, it is actually moon light. 20+ second exposures make it look
  like daylight.

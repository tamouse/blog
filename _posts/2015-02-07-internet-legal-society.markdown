>   Internet Legal Society is a not for profit disorganization dedicated to
> applying the fundamentals of the jury system to complex legal research.  To
> this end, the ILS performs no actual research in established legal sources,
> instead relying on the legal opinions of unschooled lay persons to resolve
> conflicts -- just like anywhere from six to twelve ordinary citizens do with
> questions of fact in life-or-death situations every day!


>   Just like the members of a jury, the members of the Internet Legal Society
> are drawn  protestingly from all walks of life.   If you have ever ventured an
> opinion on copyright, trademark, or common law assault in a newsgroup, then 
> you are a member of the Internet Legal Society!  Automatically. Whether you
> like it or not.  So, don't bother complaining.


>   The advantage of the Internet Legal Society's method of resolving disputes is
> that there is no pesky precedent to slow down deliberations.  Every problem is
> examined de novo[1], just like the International Court of Justice does in The
> Hague.  The Internet Legal Society allows you to Go Wrong With Confidence [sm]
> because your opinion can never be overturned for error in finding of law.


>   When you need an answer, although not necessarily the correct one, you can
> turn to the Internet Legal Society.

> ## Explanation:

> In this engaging scene
> [from planet Earth](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/), the Moon
> shines through cloudy skies following sunset on the evening of
> September 8. Despite the fading light, the camera's long exposure
> still recorded a colorful, detailed view of a shoreline and western
> horizon looking toward the island San Gabriel from Colonia del
> Sacramento, Uruguay. Lights from Buenos Aires, Argentina are along
> the horizon on the left, across the broad
> [Rio de la Plata estuary](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/%0Aview.php?id=4028). The
> long exposure strongly overexposed the Moon and sky around it,
> though.  So the photographer quickly snapped a shorter one to merge
> with the first image in the area around the bright lunar disk. As
> the the second image was made with a telephoto setting, the digital
> merger captures both Earth and sky, exaggerating the young Moon's
> slender crescent shape in relation to the two nearby bright
> stars. The more distant is
> [bluish Spica, alpha star](http://apod.nasa.gov/ap120823.html) of
> the constellation Virgo. Closest to the Moon is Earth's
> [evening star, planet Venus](http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/bill-dunford/%0A20130819-map.html),
> emerging from
> [a lunar occultation](http://apod.nasa.gov/ap130913.html).

excerpt: Nothing worth doing can be acheived in our lifetime
---

> Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime;
> therefore we must be saved by hope. Nothing which is true or
> beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of
> history; therefore we must be saved by faith. Nothing we do, however
> virtuous, can be accomplished alone; therefore we are saved by
> love. No virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of
> our friends or foes as it is from our standpoint. Therefore we must
> be saved by the final form of love which is forgiveness.

> As this tiny harvest mouse seemed to blow away a dandelion, who
> knows what it was wishing for.
> These heartwarming pictures of one of Britain's most elusive rodents
> were taken by amateur photographer Matt Binstead last weekend.
> He said: 'It was lovely to get these shots of the mouse in its
> element. I saw it on the stem and just waited for it to climb all
> the way to the top.

> 'It is the only British animal with what is known as a prehensile
> tail that can be used as a fifth limb.


> 'When wrapped around a stem, it can act as a brake or anchor.
> 'This makes it very nimble, travelling and feeding in stems of
> cereals and grasses.'
> Conservation measures have been in place for the species since 2001
> when it was given near-threatened status.
> It is Europe's smallest rodent, at about 6cm long, and weighs less
> than a 2p coin.
> They have many natural predators and are a snack for foxes, weasels,
> stoats, cats, owls, crows, kestrels and even toads.

> The mouse is Europe's smallest rodent, at about 6cm long, and weighs
> less than a 2p coin.
> And many of them freeze to death in the winter where they live in
> grass nests in hedgerows near the ground.
> The species don't hibernate but do sleep for long periods in the
> winter, waking up during milder spells to eat a little stored food
> or venture out on a foraging trip.

> Tennis balls used in play at Wimbledon have been recycled to create
> artificial nests for harvest mice in an attempt to help the species
> avoid predation at this time.
> They eat mainly seeds and insects but also nectar and fruit and are
> found in areas of tall grasses such as cereal crops, and in roadside
> verges, hedgerows, reedbeds, dykes and salt-marshes.

> Mr Binstead, 30, is head keeper at the British Wildlife Centre in
> Lingfield, Surrey, where the pictures were taken.
> He added: 'They have a remarkable ability to sense vibrations
> through the soles of their feet.
> 'Larger animals in the vicinity can be sensed by vibrations passing
> through the ground and up the plant on which the mouse is feeding.'

> Harvest mice breed from May to October, often producing three
> litters a year after a two-and-a-half-week gestation period.
> The young are completely independent and are abandoned by their
> mother after 16 days.

> The centre has been open to the public since 2000 and houses about
> 40 native species.

> Maybe this little one was just wishing the lovely weather will
> continue.

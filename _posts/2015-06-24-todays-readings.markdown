For today, {{ page.date }}, I'm reading and noting:


* [A Rebelle Solstice  4 Creative Traits Most Will Never Understand.  Rebelle Society](http://www.rebellesociety.com/2015/06/21/a-rebelle-solstice-4-creative-traits-most-will-never-understand/)

Particularly this quote:


<blockquote>
<p>“To be creative means to be in love with life. You can be creative
only if you love life enough that you want to enhance its beauty, you
want to bring a little more music to it, a little more poetry to it, a
little more dance to it.”</p>

* [Blessed Are Those Who Feel Too Much.  Rebelle Society](http://www.rebellesociety.com/2015/06/17/blessed-are-those-who-feel-too-much/)

This is incredibly amazing painting done by [Riusuke Fukahori](http://goldfishing.info/works/resins.html). He is painting the goldfish layer upon layer on resin, filling in details as he builds up the painting, then pouring on another layer of resin, and painting agian. The results are absolutely incredible.

> The puzzling, fascinating surface of Jupiter's icy moon Europa looms
  large in this newly-reprocessed color view, made from images taken
  by NASA's Galileo spacecraft in the late 1990s. This is the color
  view of Europa from Galileo that shows the largest portion of the
  moon's surface at the highest resolution.

> The scene shows the stunning diversity of Europa's surface
  geology. Long, linear cracks and ridges crisscross the surface,
  interrupted by regions of disrupted terrain where the surface ice
  crust has been broken up and re-frozen into new patterns.

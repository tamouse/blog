* Intro to <http://surfraw.alioth.debian.org/>:

> Surfraw provides a fast unix command line interface to a variety of
> popular WWW search engines and other artifacts of power. It reclaims
> google, altavista, babelfish, dejanews, freshmeat, research index,
> slashdot and many others from **the false-prophet, pox-infested
> heathen lands of html-forms, placing these wonders where they
> belong, deep in unix heartland, as god loving extensions to the
> shell.**

> Surfraw abstracts the browser away from input. Doing so lets it get
> on with what it's good at. Browsing. Interpretation of linguistic
> forms is handed back to the shell, which is what it, and human
> beings are good at. Combined with netscape-remote or incremental
> text browsers, such as lynx, links or w3m, along with screen a
> Surfraw liberateur is capable of navigating speeds that leave **GUI
> tainted idolaters agape with fear and wonder.**

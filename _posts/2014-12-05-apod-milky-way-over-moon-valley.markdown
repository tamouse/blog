> Galaxy arcs over a [desolate landscape](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap031109.html) in this fantastic
> [panoramic night skyview](https://500px.com/photo/89668537/milky-way-over-moon-valley-by-rafael-defavari?from=user).

> The otherworldly scene looks across the arid, eroded terrain of the

> 
> Just along the horizon are lights from
> San Pedro, Chile, as well as the small villages of Socaire and Toconao,
> and a tortuous road from the city of Calama to San Pedro.

> Taken on
> October 18th, the five panel mosaic also features the four galaxies
> easily visible from our fair planet's dark sky regions. At the far left,
> satellite galaxies known as the Large and Small [Magellanic Clouds](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060809.html) are framed by their
> terrestrial namesakes. Much fainter and at the right, beyond the Milky
> Way's central bulge, is the Andromeda Galaxy.

> The most [distant in view](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130927.html), Andromeda lies some 2.5
> million light-years away.

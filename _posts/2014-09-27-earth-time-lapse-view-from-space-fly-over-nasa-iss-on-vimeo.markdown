This may singularly define what it is like to live in the future now. I look at the video, I know it's from actual photographs stiched into a time-lapse sequence, and yet I still think "Wow, that's an excellent CGI movie of traveling around the earth." I'm so strange sometimes.

[Earth](http://vimeo.com/32001208) from [Michael König](http://vimeo.com/michaelkoenig) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).

Time lapse sequences of photographs taken by the crew of expeditions 28 & 29 onboard the International Space Station from August to October,

2011, who to my knowledge shot these pictures at an altitude of around
350 km. All credit goes to them.

HD, refurbished, smoothed, retimed, denoised, deflickered, cut, etc. All in all I tried to keep the looks of the material as original as possible, avoided adjusting the colors and the like, since in my opinion the original footage itself already has an almost surreal and aestethical visual nature.

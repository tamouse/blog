So a friend of mine showed me this, a
[![BBQ Donut Boat]({{ p |  append: page.gallery.images[0] | append: ".jpg"}})]({{ page.source}})

At first, it was the sillyest thing I've seen in a while, but then,
all of a sudden... I understood it's absolute brilliance: Fun, Sun,
Friends on the Lake, Barbecue, Floating on Water... WE COULD HAVE IT
ALL!

All for the low, low price of $32,000 dollars, with UK delivery...

Some additional hightlights:

> Ever wished you and ten friends could sit under an umbrella and cook
> up a BBQ all while floating on a lake? Course you have, who hasn’t?

> Well, with the deliciously (if confusingly) named BBQ Donut Boat
> we’re excited to introduce one pretty fantastic floating food
> barge. Seating up to 10 people and featuring a specially installed
> BBQ grill, you can even correct your course between courses with the
> compact outboard engine.

> With loads of storage under the seats and the fully adjustable sun
> shade, you can take to the (not so) high seas for hours. The BBQ is
> a low smoke charcoal kettle grill, especially setup to ensure
> maximum safety and ease of use and the moulded table settings ensure
> your sausages and steaks won’t slide off.

> With a movable side section for easy boarding, and all necessary
> rigging and safety features, you’ll be able to tuck in to your
> floating feast without a care in the world. Plus, as with every good
> BBQ Donut Boat, there are plenty of customisation options and
> extras.

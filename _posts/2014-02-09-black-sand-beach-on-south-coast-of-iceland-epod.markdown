Black Sand Beach on South Coast of Iceland

> The photo above shows a [black sand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_sand) and pebble beach near the town of [Vik i Myrdal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%ADk_%C3%AD_M%C3%BDrdal), the [southernmost](http://en.south.is/) settlement in [Iceland](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ic.html).  This sand originated from the [basalt lava](http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/what-are-different-types-basaltic-lava-flows-and-how-do-they-form) that covers much of the area. Because black sand isn’t routinely replenished like most beach sand when storms and tides wash the sand away, black sand beaches tend not to endure very long.

> The [geology of Iceland](http://www.tobias-weisenberger.de/6Iceland.html) is comparatively young -- it owes its existence to the [Mid-Atlantic Ridge](http://www.mnh.si.edu/earth/text/4_3_1_0.html) that splits the island in half.  [Volcanoes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_volcanoes_in_Iceland) along the ridge, such as [Katla](http://www.volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=372030), erupt with some regularity continuing to add surface area and mass to the “land of ice and fire” and to augment the black sand beaches. Photo taken near sunset on October 3, 2012.

> 
> Senegal is home to Lake Retba aka Lac Rose, which is naturally pink. Due
> to its high salt content, the water has the perfect living conditions
> for a certain kind of micro-algae called *dunaliella salina*. The
> presence of these organisms is what gives the lake its pink hue. That is
> wayyyy too much for my tiny peanut brain to handle. You know what I
> think it is? Mother Nature is showing off her feminine side! Ooh girl,
> you tryina get Father Timeâ€™s attention? I feel ya, but you gotta hit it
> and quit it because the man is not getting any younger.

This is a pretty cool invention and use.

> [MusicInk](http://musicink.co/), created by product designers Gilda
> Negrini and Riccardo Vendramin and software engineer Luong Bui, is a
> prototype kit that turns paper into functioning, noise-making
> instruments through conductive paint and an Arduino. The kit comes
> with a set of stencils that children use to paint various
> instruments onto a piece of paper using the carbon paint from Bare
> Conductive, the same paint that was used in Calvin Harris' human
> instrument video for “Humanthesizer.” There's a guitar with strings,
> a trumpet, drum, and piano key. After adding a couple of coats, each
> painting is connected to an Arduino Duemilanove board with a
> Sparkfun MPR121via electrodes and cables. 

> The brains of the Arduino is synced up with a smartphone app via
> Bluetooth, essentially turning the paper instruments into capacitive
> sensors that react to gestures. So every time a child taps a drum,
> pushes down on a trumpet's valve or strums a guitar, a musical
> sound, all recorded by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, is
> emitted. The controller box holds up to 12 electrodes, so a group of
> children can be playing instruments simultaneously, like a
> paper-made orchestra. “Children's reactions are extraordinary,” say
> the designers. “It's beautiful to see their amazed face when they
> realize they can play a simple piece of paper. 

> It is a little bit magical to watch as a piece of paper transforms
> into an interactive instrument. And upon first seeing the
> instruments in action, it feels almost as though you're in a cartoon
> where a simple action provokes a surreal outcome. The gestures are
> simple enough for children to understand, and the designers plan on
> making the kit even more intuitive, customizable and possibly
> wireless, before they make it available to purchase. Their hope,
> they say, is to create a low-cost, customizable product that will
> challenge children to think about music in a new way. “We think that
> giving a different and more tangible way to learn something
> theoretical, like the basics of music, might be very interesting
> both for children and teachers,” they say. “We, as designers, think
> that learning is easier when made with something practical.”

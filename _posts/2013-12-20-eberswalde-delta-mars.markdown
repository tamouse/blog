[![Eberswalde Delta, Mars](/images/astronomy/eberswalde-delta-mars.jpg "Eberswalde Delta on Mars")](/images/astronomy/eberswalde-delta-mars-big.jpg)

> This image covers a portion of Eberswalde Crater on Mars, revealing
  a possible delta-lake transition. Water flowed into the crater
  through a series of tributary channels to the west of the crater and
  after the water entered, it formed a distributive network and partly
  filled the crater to form a lake (Eberswalde Crater is approximately
  70 kilometers wide and 1.2 kilometers deep).


> The bright layers are part of the terminal scarp at the eastern edge
  of the delta. Some of the steeper slopes visible at the edge of the
  fan may be coarser-grained resistant channel ridges. The CRISM
  instrument on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has detected
  phyllosilicates (clays) in the bright layers. One of the ways clays
  form on Earth is when water erodes rock and makes fine particles
  which settle out of water; this often occurs in river deltas and
  lake beds. The delta in Eberswalde Crater and the detection of
  phyllosilicates provides evidence for possible persistent aqueous
  activity on Mars.

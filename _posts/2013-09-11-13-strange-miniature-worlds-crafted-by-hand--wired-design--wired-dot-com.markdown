> Inside London’s Ronchini Gallery, miniature, lifelike worlds are
> scattered about the white-walled rooms. Houses, people and landscapes
> all looking like they could have been ripped from the pages of *Alice in
> Wonderland* after the heroine sips her shrinking potion. The tiny works
> of art are part of [*Dream No Small Dreams*](http://www.ronchinigallery.com/archives/mostre/dream-no-small-dreams-the-miniature-worlds-of-adrien-broom-thomas-doyle-and-patrick-jacobs),
> a newly opened exhibition curated by Bartholomew F. Bland that features
> pieces from Patrick Jacobs, Thomas Doyle and Adrien Broom, three New
> York City-based artists who are known for aiming a microscopic lens on
> humanity.
> 
> Each artist works in his or her preferred
> medium—[Jacobs](http://www.patrickjacobs.info/) in diorama,
> [Doyle](http://www.thomasdoyle.net/) in sculpture and
> [Broom](http://www.adrienbroom.com/#mi=1&pt=0&pi=1&p=-1&a=0&at=0) in
> photography—but all are united by their ability to craft intricately
> detailed scenes in small scale. “When you work small, you can suggest
> very big things,” explains Jacobs. “Utilized in the right way, the
> tension created in that contradiction gives it meaning.” With their
> doll-sized features you could almost call the works cute, if only the
> scenes themselves weren’t so eerie. That contrast is most evident in
> Doyle’s work, with its sculpted American-dream houses that appear
> comforting until you realize they’re on the brink of toppling into a
> sinkhole or have been torn apart in the back. Enclosed inside glass
> domes, the mixed media pieces are meant to explore the ideas of fear,
> anxiety, isolation and the dashing of best intentions.”The smaller scale
> works well with these ideas, as you have to get close to the works to
> engage with them,” he explains. “Doing so forges a curious bond – you
> are hovering above them, far more powerful, yet when you see things at
> their level you can connect intimately with the situations the people in
> the works are enduring.”

> Adrien Broom, *Waltz*. Broom builds the miniature sets found in her

> 
> Similarly, Broom’s photography feels as though you’re peeking inside the
> surreal dreams of a spooky doll.  The photographer, who is best known
> for her beautifully bizarre life-size sets, constructs the mini-sets in
> her studio, using dirt, mirrors, malleable material or whatever she
> happens to have around. “In ‘Untitled’ I knew I wanted to play with
> shapes of smoke and have that become a character in itself,” she
> explains. “I had a smoke machine set up below a small set I built, with
> a hole in the base for light and smoke to rise from.” The resulting
> images are gorgeous, if full of anxiety and isolation.
> 
> Jacobs’ work is perhaps the most inviting of the exhibition, both in
> mood and in the way it forces viewers to fully engage by peering into a
> wall-installed dioramas. The artist builds each photo-realistic piece
> while looking through a slightly concave lens. Using fine tweezers,
> Jacobs arranges his materials—cat hair, aluminum foil, scraps of paper
> and plastic— and uses effects like foreshortening, forced perspective
> and LED lighting, to bring each diorama to life. Once installed in
> walls, the works are like little windows to a fascinating alternate
> reality. “I’m looking to engage the viewer directly on a kind of
> journey,” says Jacobs. “If I can hold your attention for even a short
> time, suspend disbelief and make you question where it is we’re going, I
> think I’ve succeeded.”
> 
> The show will be at the [Ronchini
> Gallery](http://www.ronchinigallery.com/) until October 6.

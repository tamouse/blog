Today's image on [apod](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130820.html) shows
a startling image of Venus transiting the Sun:

![Venus Solar Eclipse]({{ base_url }}/images/sunvenus_300.jpg)

The dark spot in the upper mid-left in front of the Sun is Venus
making it's transit.

The starling image is a composite of 3 different colours in the
ultraviolet region from the Solar Dynamics Observatory.

Do pop on over to [apod](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130820.html)
to see a much larger version and for a better explanation.

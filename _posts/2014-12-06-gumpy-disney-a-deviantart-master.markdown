[DeviantArtist TsaoShin](http://tsoashin.deviantart.com) (aka Eric Proctor) has won the [Deviousness Award](http://fourteenthstar.deviantart.com/journal/Celebrating-Deviousness-December-2014-496730846) for his wonderful mashups of Disney movies and the Internet's most famous grumpy cat.

TsaoShin's [Grumpy Disney Gallery]({{ page.source }}) is full of great images he's created with one simple rule: 

> "The appearance of the cat must derail the plot of the film."

This is really so awesome, and he's quite talented.

Head on [over]({{ page.source }}) and check them all out. His other work is fabulous as well. Well-deserved award!

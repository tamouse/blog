> In the company of lesbians of my generation and older, I frequently hear

> The question is driven in part by nostalgia, and in part by discomfort
> with what seems to have been a shift in the way young lesbians think
> about gender.
> 
> And the first question often leads to others: Why are all the butches
> becoming men? Why can’t they understand that gender is a social
> construct, and that women don’t have to conform to a feminine ideal?
> Isn't that what we were fighting for -- a world in which women could wear
> tool belts and neckties and do anything we damn well please, without the
> constraints of gender?
> 
> At its very core, this was the vision of the feminist movement, and
> lesbians more than anyone understood how transformative this could be.
> 
> Years ago, I asked the same questions, but today, this conversation
> makes me uncomfortable. Because I am of this older generation, I have
> seen things change -- and not change -- for a long time.
> 
> I have, in my life, loved many butches. My relationships and affairs
> have almost always been with masculine women and, more recently, with
> trans men as well.
> 
> In my experience, for as long as I have found myself in intimate
> circumstances with butches/studs/masculine-identified women -- from way
> back when I was too young to be in the bars where I was meeting and
> going home with them -- a curious thing happens. Once there is enough
> trust established, I become witness to a moment of confession. The
> confession goes something like this: "I don't know how to explain this,
> but I don't exactly feel like a woman. I mean, I'm butch, and that's
> close, but honestly, I'm not sure what I am."
> 
> Don't get me wrong, there are many, many proud butch women who are
> exactly that: women. In today's terminology, their gender expression is
> masculine, and their gender identity is female. They wear their tool
> belts proudly, and I am happy to admire the show. For them, a butch
> identity resolves the issue -- if people have a problem with it, it's
> their sexism or homophobia rearing its head.  
> 
> But that experience is not everyone's, and it never has been. Butches
> may look a lot alike on the outside, but they aren't the same on the
> inside.
> 
> In the mid 1990s, as a grad student, I wrote about the lesbian history
> of Detroit. I interviewed 48 women who had lived as lesbians between
> 1930 and 1970. When I met them, these women were mostly in their sixties
> and seventies. Of the 48, four --  almost 10% -- said that if they were
> young today, they would transition their gender and become men.  
> 
> This didn't surprise me, really, because of all those late-night
> confessions I'd already heard. I knew that for many, "butch" was the
> closest they could come to a word that would describe the experience of
> being a masculine person in a woman's body. But for these folks, while
> "butch" was better than "woman" or “lesbian,” it still fell short.
> You've probably heard butches who say that they don't use the term
> "butch lesbian," but prefer simply "butch." This isn't a denial of
> sexual orientation, but a claiming of a complicated gender identity.  
> 
> One of the mistakes that we made as lesbian feminists is that we
> combined sexual orientation and gender expression into an androgynous
> dyke ideal: short hair, no makeup, able to fix a car or bake bread with
> equal ease, frequently accused of being in the wrong public restroom
> (much to our outrage). 
> 
> How did you know you were a lesbian? You got thrown out of Girl Scouts
> and hated Barbie, and never felt comfortable in a dress and heels. But
> as well-intentioned as we may have been, plenty of lesbians never fit
> that ideal. Not just trans men but also lesbians like me, who pored over
> *Glamour* magazine and loved anything that sparkled. The orientation
> fit, but my attempts at correct dyke behavior were a miserable failure.
>  
> 
> In short, the gender of who we love has always been a separate question
> from our own gender expression, and our attempt to consolidate gender
> identity and expression with sexual orientation has led us to a
> fundamental misunderstanding of the trans experience.
> 
> When lesbians ask where the butches have gone, what we're saying is that
> we don't understand trans men. We are stuck on three core beliefs:  
> 
> For many of us, particularly of an older generation, being out and proud
> lesbians and feminists has been our life's journey -- and hard won. The
> communities that we've built as a shelter from the storm of a misogynist
> culture are particularly dear. As one close friend said to me, "I love
> being a woman so much that I can't imagine giving that up." And the idea
> of becoming a man -- with all the unearned, unexamined privilege that the
> idea suggests -- is especially incomprehensible; it's a betrayal of
> trust.
> 
> Others believe that choosing to transition from being butch to being a
> man shows a lack of courage or imagination, that somehow the person
> wasn't brave enough to be a butch woman.  
> 
> Still others think we've failed as a community to create a space in
> which any woman can dress and act as she pleases. That was my first
> reaction to those Detroit butches and studs: that the times were so hard
> that it had made them long for escape. I wondered if, had they been born
> a generation later, they might have found support in lesbian feminist
> communities that they were lacking in the rough-and-tumble bar culture
> that was their only refuge.  
> 
> But I have since learned that transition is not a betrayal, a lack of
> courage, or a desire to escape a unwelcoming community. That's what
> these Detroit butches and studs taught me. They lived their lives with

> 
> But for some, the hard-won space and freedom to try out different forms

> Most trans men I know came out as lesbians, then claimed a butch

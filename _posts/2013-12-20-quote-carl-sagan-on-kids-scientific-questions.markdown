> # Many adults are put off when youngsters pose scientific   questions. Children ask why the sun is yellow, or what a dream is, or  how deep you can dig a hole, or when is the world's birthday, or why  we have toes.
> &mdash; Carl Sagan,

Continuing:

> Too many teachers and parents answer with irritation or ridicule, or
  quickly move on to something else. Why adults should pretend to
  omniscience before a five-year-old, I can't for the life of me
  understand. What's wrong with admitting that you don't know?
  Children soon recognize that somehow this kind of question annoys
  many adults. A few more experiences like this, and another child has
  been lost to science.


> There are many better responses. If we have an idea of the answer,
  we could try to explain. If we don't, we could go to the
  encyclopedia or the library. Or we might say to the child: "I don't
  know the answer. Maybe no one knows. Maybe when you grow up, you'll
  be the first to find out."

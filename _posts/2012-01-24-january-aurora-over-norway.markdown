> ## Explanation:

> What's that in the sky? An aurora. A large [coronal mass ejection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection) occurred on our Sun five days ago, [throwing a cloud](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gMshhlGe4w) of fast moving electrons, protons, and ions [toward](http://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20120123_052000_anim.tim-den.gif) the Earth. 

> Although most of this [cloud passed](http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/01/21/10207087-solar-weather-sparks-super-sights) above the Earth, some of it impacted our Earth's [magnetosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere) and resulted in [spectacular auroras](http://spaceweather.com/aurora/gallery_01jan12_page2.htm) being seen at high northern latitudes. 

> Pictured above is a particularly photogenic [auroral corona](http://www.atoptics.co.uk/highsky/aurim10.htm) captured last night above Grotfjord, [Norway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway). 

> To some, this [shimmering green glow](ap110328.html) of recombining atmospheric [oxygen](http://periodic.lanl.gov/8.shtml) might appear as a large [eagle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle), but feel free to [share](http://asterisk.apod.com/discuss_apod.php?date=120124) what it looks like to you. 

> This round of solar activity is not yet over -- a new and even more powerful solar flare occurred [yesterday](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzYcddwZaPw) that might provide more [amazing aurora](ap110517.html) as soon as tonight.

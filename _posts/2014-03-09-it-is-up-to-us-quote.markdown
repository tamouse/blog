Carl Sagan's epic homily, Pale Blue Dot, is intensely personal, and fills me with such quickened emotion and erupts in tears every time I hear it.
However, this isn't the image that inspired Sagan's thoughts.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot) of course has a page on the image, and Carl Sagan's legacy. The Earth is just a faint, faint dot:

that is in the lower right quadrant. Most images shown greatly enhance the image to make the Earth more discernible. 

NASA's Sky Image Lab has a [page](http://www.skyimagelab.com/pale-blue-dot.html?source=pbdcom) dedicated to this image.

And recently, the Cassini space probe has also [imaged](http://www.skyimagelab.com/cassini-tiny-blue-dot.html#sthash.wajwOHfZ.dpbs) Earth from out near Saturn.

*******

These are great images, and great accomplishments.

However, it is Carl's words that are most compelling, putting such an image into context, and really, *really* driving home the point here:

> &ldquo;Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity -- in all this vastness -- there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. 

> &ldquo; It is up to us.

It is.

Up to us.

All of us.

Together.

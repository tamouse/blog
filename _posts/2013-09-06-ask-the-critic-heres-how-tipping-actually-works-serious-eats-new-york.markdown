> To answer that question, we've gotta get into the nuts and bolts of how
> tipping actually works in New York City. (And here, we are talking about New York City; practices vary across
> this nation of ours.)

> Unless you're in the habit of tipping with a handshake, sliding a
> $20-or-whatever directly into your server's hand, here's the reality:
> **your tip does not go directly to your waiter.**
> 
> Read that last bit again, it's important. Probably the biggest

> Many restaurants allot payout via a points system, in which tips are

> amount you're penciling in goes into the pocket of helpful waitress
> Lauren or bartender Steve? Well, not quite.
> 
> 
> #### Here's An Example
> 
> Head down the math road with me for just a mo'.
> 
> Let's take a medium-sized Manhattan establishment, a restaurant with a
> decent-sized bar. Say there are 2 bartenders, 6 servers, 2 bussers and 2
> runners. And let's say, in this establishment, that the servers and
> bartenders get 10 points and everyone else gets 5. (There should
> probably be more staff and the runners might make more than the bussers,
> but I needed an example with nice round numbers, 'kay?)
> 
> That's 8 ten-pointers (2 bartenders, 6 servers) and 4 five-pointers (2
> bussers, 2 runners), making for 100 points in total (8x10 + 4x5). Let's
> say the restaurant took in \$3,000 in tips last night. Under this
> system, each "point" is worth $30 ($3000 total intake/100 total
> points). Thus, the bartenders and servers get $300 each. The other
> folks, $150. Not too bad.
> 
> Now let's say your server was *terrible.* Totally distant and
> indifferent, mixed up orders, left you alone for long periods of time,
> spilled something on your date and didn't apologize, screwed up the
> check. First of all: you might want to mention something to the manager,
> rather than just take it out in a tip. But it's an understandable
> impulse to tip less. Let's say your dinner was $100. You'd usually tip
> $20; tonight, you tip $5. *That'll show him!*
> 
> And sure, there's a bit of a psychological hit, a wake-up when someone
> tips you a measly 5%. But how does the money actually play out? You
> didn't knock that waiter down by $15, as it may seem. You knocked the
> *pool* down by $15. So let's take the scenario above. Now, the total
> tip haul of $3000 is down to $2985. Each point is worth $29.85. So
> that terrible waiter makes... $298.50 instead of $300. The difference?
> $1.50.
> 
> A buck-fifty, six quarters, is the difference between 20% and 5% for
> that waiter, on a pretty sizable check. We call tipping an incentive.
> How much of an incentive is that, *really?*
> 
> #### Of Course, It Varies
> 
> Sure, there's a lot of variation. In some restaurants, for instance, the
> bar keeps its own cash at the end of the night. (Though still, that
> money isn't just going to "your" bartender; there are barbacks, too, the
> guys who cut the garnish and fill your water and do just about every
> damn other thing, who need to be tipped out.) Here's the real truth of
> it: **you don't know where your tip is going.** And there's no way *to*
> know, unless you're going to be that guy who asks how the tips are
> distributed just so you make sure your money is going to the "right
> place." (Please don't ever be that guy. I hope that guy doesn't exist.)
> Think of it like paying taxes. You may *want* more for education or less
> for the military or more for city police, but the vast majority of us
> just fork over our share without any real idea of how it works out.
> 
> **If you want a better chance of your server keeping the tip**, always
> tip in cash. If you see your tip as a very specific thank-you—a host
> managed to sneak in your party of 10 last-minute, a bartender spent all
> night mixing off-menu drinks for you, a server pulled out all the stops
> for your date's birthday—that's best handled with a bill or few slipped
> into a handshake. (Though even that should be on top of a standard,
> on-table tip. Or you're stiffing those food runners again.)
> 
> So to answer your question—*the bartender did care for our meal by
> providing us with silverware and clearing empty dishes but does that
> sort of service require the same tip as what you'd give a waitress at a
> table in the dining room?*—**yes, it does.** Because, between the runner
> and bartender and busser and everyone else you interacted with, the
> service you received essentially adds up to what you would've gotten at
> a table.
> 
> **It's a messy system, right?** It's a messy system for the workers as
> well. Imagine taking a job where you don't know your own salary. And
> where there isn't a definitive way to know. My significant other is a
> bartender and cocktail designer, and within the last year, got a job
> offer from a very well-regarded and *always*-crowded restaurant, where
> the "cheap" beers start at $8; wine and cocktails, $14. At first, he
> was thrilled; those crowds and check prices must translate to a lot of
> money for the staff, right? But he talked to a few other bartenders and
> realized... they were making around $100 less per night than he was at
> his current job, where the crowds weren't as thick and the average check
> wasn't as high. Why? There were so many staff on the floor that the pool
> got stretched thin, and the tip distribution wasn't favorable to the
> bartenders. Every restaurant is different.
> 
> Occasionally I'll visit him at work, and sometimes I don't end up with a
> bill; my drinks are rung up on his buyback check. But even when I don't
> get charged, I always tip, at least 20% on what I "should have" paid. He
> pushed back my money once; "Why don't you just keep that $15 and take a
> cab home?" It's not for *you*, silly. It's for your barback with a
> 5-year-old whose wife is 8 months pregnant, who always makes sure my
> water glass is full and keeps me in good conversation when you're at the
> other end of the bar; and it's for everyone else in the establishment.
> (And yes, some of it's for you, too.)
> 
> Moral of the story? Always tip the full now-standard 18-20%, because
> it's not just your waiter or bartender you're paying out; it's the
> runners who are sending money home to their parents, and bussers who are
> supporting kids on their tip money, too.
> 
> Don't like the system? Thinking "Why is taking care of the employees
> *my* business?" Well, because you're eating at a restaurant in America,
> and by doing so, electing to participate. And maybe some day we'll
> figure out a different system, like every other goddamned country. But
> for now, this is what we got.

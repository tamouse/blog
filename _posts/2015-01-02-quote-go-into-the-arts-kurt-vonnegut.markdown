> Go into the arts. I'm not kidding. The arts are not a way to make a
> living. They are a very human way of making life more
> bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way
> to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake.

> Sing in the shower. Dance to
> the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy
> poem. 

> Do it as well as you possibly can. You will get an enormous
> reward. You will have created something."

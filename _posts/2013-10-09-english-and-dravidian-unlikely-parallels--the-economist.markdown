Comparing and constrasting two languages that mug other languages for
words, pronounciation, and culture.

> IF FORCED to pick my favourite part of the history of English, I'd

> Vowel Shift, the mid-millennium change in pronunciation that largely
> explains English's inconsistent spelling? Perhaps I'd turn to

> But my favourite must be the Norman invasion of 1066. When the
> Normans, who spoke a dialect of Old French, ruled over England, they
> changed the face of English. Over the ensuing two centuries,
> thousands of Old French words entered English. Because the ruling
> class spoke Old French, that set of vocabulary became synonymous
> with the elite. Everyone else used Old English. During this period,
> England's society was diglossic: one community, two language sets
> with distinct social spheres. Today, English-speakers pick and
> choose from the different word sets—Latinate (largely Old French
> borrowings) and Germanic (mostly Old English-derived
> words)—depending on the occasion. Although English is no longer in a
> diglossic relationship with another language, the Norman-era
> diglossia remains reflected in the way we choose and mix
> vocabulary. In informal chat, for example, we might *go on* to *ask*
> something, but in formal speech we'd *proceed* to *inquire*. There
> are hundreds of such pairs: *match*/*correspond*, *mean*/*intend*,
> *see*/*perceive*, *speak*/*converse*. Most of us choose one or the
> other without even thinking about the history behind the
> split. Germanic words are often described as earthier, simpler, and
> friendlier. Latinate vocabulary, on the other hand, is lofty and
> elite. It's amazing that nine hundred years later, the social and
> political structure of 12th-century England still affects how we
> think about and use English.

> English isn't alone in having this sort of split
> personality. Halfway across the world, languages spoken in southern
> India underwent similar changes. Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, and
> Telugu, the four major languages spoken there, are Dravidian
> languages. They are structurally unrelated to the languages of
> northern India, which are Indo-European. But Sanskrit, an
> Indo-European language of ancient India and the liturgical language
> of Hinduism, has held prestige all over the subcontinent for over
> two thousand years. Kannada, Telugu, and Malayalam—and to a lesser
> extent Tamil—have absorbed, and continue to absorb, thousands of
> Sanskrit words. (A
> [relatively recent movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Tamil)
> among Tamil-speakers aimed to expunge the Sanskrit borrowings.) Much
> of southern India, just like Norman England, was diglossic between
> Sanskrit (used ritually and formally by Hindu elites) and vernacular
> Dravidian languages. Today, that diglossia is gone, but
> Sanskrit-derived vocabulary still forms an upper crust, mostly
> pulled out for formal speech or writing.

> Some writing, especially poetry, still slants toward native
> vocabulary. Two influential religious movements among Hindu
> Kannada-speakers, the 12th-century Lingāyat and the 16th-century
> Haridāsa movements, treasured simple Kannada poetry. These movements
> arose in part to spread religious teachings beyond Sanskrit-educated
> elites to the common people. Works written then are largely devoid
> of obvious Sanskrit borrowings. To many Kannada-speakers, those
> works are softer and folksier than stiffer Sanskrit-heavy works. But
> caste and class politics didn't end then, of course.  Sanskrit still
> holds sway in India today, officially one of the "scheduled"
> languages listed in the constitution. It sometimes seems like any
> Kannada newscaster or speechwriter worth his salt swears by a
> Sanskrit dictionary. Sanskrit borrowings are used all over the place
> in order to sound proper, even when it sounds strange. (My favourite
> example of strained usage is the upscaling of "toilet" to
> *shauchālaya*, "abode of cleanliness".) In the most tortured formal
> writing, Sanskrit words might just be strung together with Kannada
> grammatical endings. This has the strange consequence of allowing
> speakers of unrelated languages like Hindi to take a stab at
> translating the text. (Hindi, as it happens, is also split between
> the Sanskrit-heavy *shuddh, *"pure", Hindi, popular in government
> and academia, and colloquial Hindi, which makes greater use of
> Arabic and Persian borrowings.) There's some sweet spot in the
> middle of both extremes. Good writers seem to get it best.

> It has always fascinated me how the Sanskrit/Dravidian divide in
> Kannada is so strikingly similar to the Latinate/Germanic divide in
> English. In English, word choice is often used to judge someone's
> class or education. In Kannada, caste is also mixed in. Picking
> certain words over others can have social consequences, branding the
> speaker or writer according to his vocabulary. In both languages,
> older borrowings underwent sound and spelling changes, but newer
> borrowings keep the roots intact. (In English, these old pre-Norman
> borrowings are mainly religious terms, like "nun", "monk", or
> "priest".) "Native" terms are considered earthier and
> Sanskrit/Latin-derived borrowings are stuffier. But there are
> interesting differences, too. English didn't descend from Latin,
> though they're both Indo-European. Dravidian languages, in contrast,
> aren't related to Sanskrit at all. In Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam,
> the alphabet had to expand dramatically to incorporate Sanskrit
> sounds like voicing and aspiration. The shift was so complete that
> each language's alphabet, while written completely distinctly,
> contains nearly all of the same sounds as the Sanskrit-descended
> Hindi.

> Many languages have "high" and "low" layers of vocabulary. But in
> most other languages, the two sets are drawn from the same
> source. By contrast, contact between Old English and French,
> Dravidian languages and Sanskrit, Japanese and Chinese, Persian and
> Arabic, and other pairings around the world have created
> fascinatingly hybrid languages. These mixed lexicons are, for
> linguistic and social historians, akin to the layers of fossils that
> teach paleontologists and archaeologists so much about eras gone by.


> Some people even think English is descended from Latin, or Kannada
> from Sanskrit. That's frustrating not only because it's wrong, but
> also because the reality is far more interesting.

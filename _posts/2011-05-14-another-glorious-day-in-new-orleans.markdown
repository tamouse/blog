We had so much fun today. First was another tour of the Tulane campus, pictures by daylight today! We stopped in at the campus bookstore and I picked some Tulane swag.

Then we went to lunch at the Commanders Palace, which was really fabulous. Great food and highly attentive service. Their speciality is this bread pudding souffle, which I got to sample. However I was correctly stared to the strawberry shortcake, which was heavenly. The salad to start was suberb, and the crawfish stew was excellent. It came with a whole steamed crawfish on top which was cute and tasty.

Next we went down to the French Quarter and wandered about, and I took tons of pictures. We ended up at Cafe du Mode for cafe au la it and beignets. The beignets had tons of powdered sugar on them, which tended to go everywhere. So much fun! :-)

After a walk along the Mississippi, we headed of for a bit of a rest.

Finally, we walked over to the Voodoo BBQ for a real tasty meal. Well stuffed and talked out we came back to the hotel and said goodbyes to various family and friends.

Heading back home tomorrow morning. I can see why ppl fall in love with New Orleans!

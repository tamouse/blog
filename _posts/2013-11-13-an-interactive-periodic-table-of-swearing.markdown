> [Modern Toss](http://shop.moderntoss.com/) has created an [interactive online Periodic Table of Swearing](http://ptos.moderntoss.com/) that reads out amusing British profanity like “Cock Garage” (Cg) and “Prat in a Hat” (Ph) when you click on each swear. The interactive chart is based on [the real-life Periodic Table of Swearing](http://laughingsquid.com/the-periodic-table-of-swearing/) designed by [Modern Toss](http://shop.moderntoss.com/) and built by [Clay Interactive](http://www.clayinteractive.co.uk/). An Android app version of the profane periodic table is also [available to purchase online from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thisisdare.moderntoss&hl=en).

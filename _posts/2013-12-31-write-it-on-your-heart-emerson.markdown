> Write it on your heart  
> that every day is the best day in the year.  
> He is rich who owns the day, and no one owns the day  
> who allows it to be invaded with fret and anxiety.  
> Finish every day and be done with it.  
> You have done what you could.  
> Some blunders and absurdities, no doubt crept in.  
> Forget them as soon as you can, tomorrow is a new day;  
> begin it well and serenely, with too high a spirit  
> to be cumbered with your old nonsense.  
> This new day is too dear,  
> with its hopes and invitations,  
> to waste a moment on the yesterdays.  

&mdash; Ralph Waldo Emerson

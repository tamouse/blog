In [parts](http://www.chinare.gov.cn/en/?pid=stations&st=zhongshan) of
[Antarctica](http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-antarctica-58.html),
not only is it winter, but the Sun can spend weeks below the horizon. At
China's [Zhongshan
Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Zhongshan_Station),
people sometimes venture out into the cold to photograph a spectacular
night sky. The featured image from one such outing was taken in
mid-July, [just before the
end](http://dateandtime.info/citysunrisesunset.php?id=6620792) of this
[polar night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_night). Pointing up,
the [wide angle lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-angle_lens)
captured not only the ground at the bottom, but at the top as well. In
the foreground is a colleague also taking pictures. In the distance, a
spherical satellite receiver and several
[windmills](http://energy.gov/eere/wind/how-do-wind-turbines-work) are
visible. Numerous stars dot the night sky, including
[Sirius](http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/sirius.html) and
[Canopus](ap100514.html). Far in the background, stretching overhead
from horizon to horizon, is the [central band](ap070930.html) of our
[Milky Way Galaxy](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/milkyway.html).
Even further in the distance, visible as extended smudges near the top,
are the [Large](ap130528.html) and [Small](ap100903.html) Magellanic
[Clouds](ap140916.html), satellite galaxies near our huge [Milky Way
Galaxy](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cosmic/milkyway_info.html).

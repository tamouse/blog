> "It is a characteristic of human nature to be inclined to regard anything which is disagreeable as untrue, and then without much difficulty to find arguments against it. So society pronounces the unacceptable as untrue, disputes the result... with logical and concrete arguments, arising, however, in emotional sources, and clings to them with all the strength of prejudice against every attempt at refutation."

No attribution. I'm guessing this is out of a novel.

It does, however, represent some truth in human behaviour.

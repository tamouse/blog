Altoids tin portable #watercolour paint pallette. 

This is the second attempt, I think this one will do pretty well. I used glue dots, so the pans lift out pretty easily.

*Filled: L-R: Aureolin, Rose Madder Genuine, French Ultramarine Blue, Quin Burnt Orange (2nd row:) Sap Green, Cobalt Blue, Chromatic Black from Fr. Ultra. Blue and Quin Burnt Orange.*


Aureolin, Rose Madder Gen., and Cobalt Blue make a luminous, lifting, transparent triad, super great for flowers and botanicals.

Fr. Ultramarine Blue and Quin Burnt Orange mix to make a very lustrous chromatic black.

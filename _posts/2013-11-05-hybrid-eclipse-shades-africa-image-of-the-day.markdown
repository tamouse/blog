> The last eclipse of 2013 was an unusual one. Known as a hybrid
> eclipse, the Moon blocked just part of the Sun—an
> [annular eclipse](http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/SEglossary.html)—at
> sunrise along the east coast of the Americas, and then moved into
> total eclipse along a long, narrow path across the Atlantic Ocean
> and central Africa. For a little more than three hours, the shadow
> of the Moon traced a path about 13,600 kilometers (8,500 miles) long
> but no more than 58 kilometers (36 miles) wide.

> This image above shows one orbital swath from the Visible Infrared
> Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the
> [Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership](http://npp.gsfc.nasa.gov/)
> (Suomi NPP) satellite. The yellow line shows the path of the total
> eclipse, while the map provides context for the location relative to
> central Africa. VIIRS captured this image at 13:25 Universal Time
> (1:25 p.m. local time) on November 3, 2013, about 38 minutes after
> the maximum eclipse.

> The darkened area is a combination of the umbra (full) and antumbra
> (partial) shadow of the Moon on Earth's surface. Skywatchers within
> the umbra observed a total eclipse that lasted as long as 99 seconds
> at maximum eclipse, which occurred at 12:47 Universal Time.

> Fred Espenak, an eclipse expert at NASA's Goddard Space Flight
> Center, described the blend of a partial and total eclipse. “The
> duality comes about when the vertex of the Moon's umbral shadow
> pierces Earth's surface at some locations, but falls short of the
> planet along other sections of the path. The unusual geometry is due
> to the curvature of Earth's surface that brings some geographic
> locations into the umbra while other positions are more distant and
> enter the antumbral rather than umbral shadow.”

> The 2013 event was even more unusual because the eclipse shifted
> from partial (annular) to total and then ended. Hybrid eclipses
> typically start as annular, become total, and then finish as
> annular. The last hybrid eclipse occurred on November 20, 1854, and
> the next one will not occur until October 17, 2172, according to Sky
> & Telescope
> magazine. [Click here for a map](http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/OH/OHfigures/OH2013-Fig05.pdf)

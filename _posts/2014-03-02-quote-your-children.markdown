> # Your children are not your children
> &mdash; Kahlil Gibran

Continuing:

> You may give them your love but not your thoughts,<br>For they have their own thoughts.
> You may house their bodies but not their souls.

> For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow,
> which you cannot visit, even in your dreams.  

> You are the bows from which your children, as living arrows,
> are sent forth."

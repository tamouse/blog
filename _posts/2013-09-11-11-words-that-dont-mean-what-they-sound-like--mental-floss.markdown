A great list of words that have some use, but probably incorrect. :)
Memorize these!

> 
> **1. Bodkin** must mean "little body." Didn’t Hamlet say something about
> a "bare bodkin"? He did. But he was talking about taking the "not to be"
> option, ending his suffering with a bodkin, or dagger. (Origin unknown.)
> 
> **2. Crapulous** sounds cruddy. After all if Bart Simpson uses
> craptastic to mean the opposite of fantastic, crapulous must be the
> opposite of fabulous; right? Wrong. It means "characterized by gross
> excess in drinking or eating" or "hung over." (From Latin *crapula,*
> "inebriation," and Greek *kraipalē,* "drunken headache.")
> 
> **3. Crepuscular** refers not to an oozing skin ailment but to twilight
> or to creatures active at twilight, like bats, mosquitoes, and vampires.
> (Mid 17th cent.: from Latin *crepusculum*, meaning "twilight.")
> 
> **4. Formication** may sound sexy, but it means "an abnormal sensation
> as of ants creeping over the skin." (From Latin *formīcāre*, meaning "to
> crawl like ants.")
> 
> **5. Funambulist** sounds like it should be the driver of an ambulance
> decorated with happy faces, but it’s actually a tightrope walker. (From
> Latin *fūnambul-us*—fūn-is, "rope," plus ambul-āre, "to walk’" plus the
> -ist suffix, "designating a person who practices some art or method.")
> 
> **6. Fungible** sounds like it describes a squishy, spongy fungus, but
> it’s a legal term describing goods or money that can replace or be
> replaced by equivalent items. (From medieval Latin *fungibilis; *from
> *fungi,* meaning "perform, enjoy," with the same sense as *fungi
> vice,* "serve in place of." It’s not related to fungus, which is related
> to sponge.)
> 
> **7. Noisome** doesn’t mean noisy, but stinky or otherwise disagreeable
> or offensive. (From the obsolete late Middle English word *noy*, a
> shortened form of annoy, plus *-some*, an adjective-forming suffix.)
> 
> **8. Nugatory** sounds creamy and delicious but it means unimportant, of
> no value or useless; futile. (From Latin *nugatorius;* from *nugari* "to
> trifle"; from *nugae,* or "jests.")
> 
> **9. Pulchritude** sounds like the ineptness exhibited by a lurching
> klutz, but it’s a highfalutin word for "beauty." (From Latin
> *pulchritūdō, *"beauty" by way of Middle French.)
> 
> **10. Plethora** may sound like an ancient Greek musical instrument, but
> it means an excess of something. When it entered English in the mid 16th
> century, it was a medical term for an excess of a bodily fluid,
> particularly blood. Although modern medicos have given up leech therapy,
> plethora is still used to mean an excessive volume of blood. (Via late
> Latin from Greek *plēthōrē, *and from *plēthein,* meaning "be full.")
> 
> **11. Callipygian**sounds like a bird with a suntan and a laid-back
> attitude, but it means "having shapely buttocks." (From Greek
> *kallipūgos*, which was used to describe a famous statue of Venus, and
> from *kallos, *or "beauty," and *pūgē,* or "buttocks," plus -ian.)

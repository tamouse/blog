> # "My life has been immensely enriched by gay mentors, colleagues and friends and any discrimination and persecution of gay people is unacceptable. 

> Equal treatment of people is a basic right and it is sad
that we still have to even speak about this in [the] 21st century. I
salute NO MORE FEAR foundation for stepping in so quickly to provide
the much necessary assistance to gay and lesbian people who are
fleeing prosecution and help them lead a proud life in their new
country."

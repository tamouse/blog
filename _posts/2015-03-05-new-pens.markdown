My newly ordered pens arrived today! I so love writing instruments,
and these are very fine fountain pens from [Goulet Pens][gouletpens].

A few months ago, I ordered a fountain pen for sketching with, and
I've enjoyed it so much.

A blog post from the company arrived the other day which set my
imagination going again, and I decided to splurge on a couple more
pens.

Here's what I got:

1. [Monteverde Touch Screen Stylus Fountain Tool Pen - Orange](http://www.gouletpens.com/mv35290/p/MV35290)
2. [Faber-Castell Basic Fountain Pen - Black Carbon](http://www.gouletpens.com/FB-Basic-BlackCarbon-FP/p/FB-Basic-BlackCarbon-FP)

When they arrived, I was *so* *squiffed*, I took a bunch of unboxing
pictures. Forthwith, the gallery:

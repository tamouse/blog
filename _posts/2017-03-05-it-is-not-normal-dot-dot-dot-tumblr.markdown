And in plain text:

it's not normal for your boyfriend to ignore you when you want to talk to him.

it's not normal for your boyfriend to shove you when he's angry.

it's not normal for your boyfriend to call you a dumbass or a bitch when you're in an argument.

it's not normal for your boyfriend to threaten to leave the relationship every time you defend yourself.

it's not normal for your boyfriend to invalidate your feelings.

it's not normal for your boyfriend to not tell you who he's with or where he's going.

it's not normal for your boyfriend to keep making the same detrimental mistake over and over.

it's not normal for your boyfriend to use your insecurities against you.

it's not normal for your boyfriend to make you feel guilty for having desires and needs.

it's not normal for your boyfriend to tell you that you're stupid when you cry.

it's not normal for your boyfriend to cheat on you because he's "just a stupid guy."

it's not normal for your boyfriend to rely on you when he doesn't do a thing for himself.

it's not normal for your boyfriend to hurt you intentionally.

please stop normalizing toxic romantic relationships. it's not healthy
for your partner to upset you and behave recklessly as long as he
apologizes later. apologies mean nothing after he has repeatedly
disrespected you. kisses and hugs mean nothing after he has repeatedly
disrespected you. public displays of affection mean nothing after he
has repeatedly disrespected you. promises mean nothing after he has
repeatedly disrespected you. it is not okay for him to hurt you
physically or emotionally because he said he'll change. he hasn't. he
won't. get out now because THIS! IS! NOT! NORMAL! other couples do not
go through this. other couples did NOT have to go through this to be
in a happy, wholesome place.


he is manipulative and selfish and he is making you weak every time
you agree to stay. even when you feel like "maybe this time, things
will be okay," they won't â€“ that's what he wants you to think so you
never slip from his grasp. you know as well as i do you're 50 times
overdue for "this is his last chance." this is not normal.

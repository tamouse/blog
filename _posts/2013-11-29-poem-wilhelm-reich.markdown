> The basic truths in all teachings of mankind are alike
> And amount to on common thing:
> To find your way to the thing you feel
> When you love dearly,
> Or when you create,
> Or when you build your home,
> Or when you give birth to your children,
> Or when you look at the stars at night

&mdash; Wilhelm Reich

*(Found in the front-piece of Seymour Lipschutz's "Data Structures"
 textbook.)*

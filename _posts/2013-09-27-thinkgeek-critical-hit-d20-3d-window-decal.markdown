> Back with D&D 4e first came out, we were in a campaign with a guy named
> Robin. He was the wizard in the party and he could not hit anything.
> Seriously, there could have been a rat with no defenses and he'd roll a
> 1 and get bit in the toe. It became a running joke, our poor, inept
> wizard.

> Then one day outside the local tavern, some ruffians appear and cause a
> fight. (Like you do.) Our party steps in to set things right. Robin
> casts a burst spell and it actually hits... and kills all of the party's
> horses that were tethered by the building. Yup. True story.
>
> Dice are bastards. We've all wanted to throw them, microwave them, crush
> them. It's amazing how a tiny piece of plastic can wreak so much havoc.
> The d20 Window Decal is inspired by those sportsball-through-the-window
> decals. But since we throw a lot more d20s than sportsballs, this seemed
> to be much more appropriate for our vehicles. Easy to apply and totally
> removable, the d20 Window Decal will make gamers smile and non-gamers
> look twice.

> It might look nuts but this tiny squirrel thinks nothing of making
> incredible 150-foot leaps through the trees.  As these amazing
> pictures show the southern flying squirrel becomes more bird than
> mammal as it stretches out its body into a natural glider.  Despite
> being nocturnal, the cute critter was caught on camera by British
> photographer Kim Taylor making its nighttime jumps.

> Mr Taylor used a clever combination of a 150mm camera lens and a
> special 3,500 volt high-speed flash triggered by an infra red beam
> to capture the images.

> Southern flying squirrels are lightweight at just 65g feed mostly on
> insects, nuts and acorns. 'These animals are strictly nocturnal and
> live in tree holes, such as disused woodpecker holes,' said Mr
> Taylor, 79, who runs his own studio called Warren Photographic, in
> Guildford, England. 'They feed mainly on nuts and acorns and glide
> from tree to tree on stretched skin flaps, each time losing height
> while gliding and gaining height by climbing the next tree.'

> The animal in the photos was kept in a large flight arena, provided
> with a high nest box in which it lived. At dusk it emerged from its
> nest and glided down to one of several tree trunks placed in the
> arena, and then climbed upwards to reach a feeding platform.

> An infra red beam was placed across the likely flight path of the
> squirrel, so that, when the beam was crossed, the squirrel took its
> own photo. Special high speed flash units, working on 3500 volts,
> were used to light the subject. A multi-flash system was sometimes
> used to produce three images in quick succession. A medium format
> film camera with 150 mm lens was used for the photos. It was left
> overnight, occasionally resulting in more than one photo per
> night. Several weeks of work were necessary to achieve the series of
> shots.

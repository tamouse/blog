> # What an astonishing thing a book is. 
> &mdash; Carl Sagan

> It is a flat object made
from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny
dark squiggles. But one glance at it an you are inside the mind of
another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the
millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your
head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human
inventions, binding together people who never knew each other,
citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackle of time. A book is
proof that humans are capable of working magic.

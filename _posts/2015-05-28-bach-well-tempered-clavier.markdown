Bach's signature work, "A Well-tempered Clavier" has long been a piece
that is taught to beginning students, yet contains much depth and
magnificence.

This version, performed by Pierre-Laurent Aimard set to video with a
procession through an animated lighted sculpture exhibit, is
mesmerizing and wonderful.

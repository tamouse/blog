Gorgeous, **GORGEOUS** short film, "Wanderers", narrated by the late Carl Sagan, whose words continue to shape, form, compell, and move me.

> "Herman Melville ... spoke for all the wanderers, in all epochs and meridians, saying:

>> ### 'I am tormented with an everlasting *itch* for things remote. I long to sail forbidden seas.'

This deserves nothing less than a darkened room, a large viewing screen, and a great sound system.

> Wanderers is a vision of humanity's expansion into the Solar System,
> based on scientific ideas and concepts of what our future in space might
> look like, if it ever happens. The locations depicted in the film are
> digital recreations of actual places in the Solar System, built from
> real photos and map data where available.
> 
> Without any apparent story, other than what you may fill in by
> yourself, the idea of the film is primarily to show a glimpse of the
> fantastic and beautiful nature that surrounds us on our neighboring
> worlds - and above all, how it might appear to us if we were there.

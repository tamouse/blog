A rather interesting article describing how there are times when the
universe (or at least our local observable portion of it) reacts to a
common human experience.

[A Disturbance in the Force](http://www.boundary.org/bi/randomness.htm)

> The tragic events of September 11, 2001 have deeply shocked the
entire world. But perhaps their influence propagates even more deeply
than we imagine, even into the fabric of reality itself, perhaps even
into events prior to their occurrence. In popular culture, this might
be called a "disturbance in the Force", but new and innovative science
may have something much more serious to say about the matter.

Interstate highways that run through major urban centers eventually
choke them out and end up falling apart as maintenance costs soar out
of sight. Tear them down, build something human-scale instead. The
question "But where will all the traffic go?" turns out to be a
non-issue.

> 
> **Interstate highways running through dense city centers strangle the
> potential for those cities to flourish. The highways are falling apart
> anyway; let’s tear them down. The timing is perfect.**
> 
> The most loved cities in the world — like Paris, London, New York, San
> Francisco — are walkable, safe, and have wide range of services, parks
> and other amenities in close range to each other. They are “congested”
> in a good way. Younger americans (millennials), young professionals, and
> even affluent retirees are increasingly moving to more vibrant downtown
> areas to attain a more walkable life.
> 
> At the same time, America’s postwar highway infrastructure is crumbling
> and cities are faced with a hefty repair bill they can’t afford. This is
> a huge opportunity for many cities — like Buffalo, Cleveland, Dallas,
> Detroit, New Orleans, Louisville, and Seattle — to do something great.
> They all have deteriorating highways which are destroying their
> potentially most desirable properties. These highways concentrate
> traffic in a way that creates pedestrian barriers and discourages the
> building of rich communities.
> 
> Whenever the general public hears about a proposal to remove *part*of a
> inner-city highway, they part into two initial camps. A minority
> immediately understand the benefit and historical precedents for
> removing portions of these highways. However, the majority of people
> initially support the status quo and cry out, “OH GOD, WHERE WILL ALL
> THAT TRAFFIC GO!” Because of this fear, many cities end up reinforcing
> and expanding highways, which makes the traffic worse. This is called
> “induced demand.” When a highway becomes bigger, it draws in more
> traffic.

> The frustrating part is that we know what happens to the traffic. We

> In all cases, the traffic gets defused in three primary ways:
> 
> 1.  **Regional Dispersion**. Much of the traffic disappears immediately
>     because it’s just passing through to a farther destination. When the
>     West Side Highway in NYC came down, 53 percent of traffic just
>     disappeared because it was cars in New Jersey enjoying a short-cut,
>     but destroying NYC in the meantime. A variety of highways around the
>     city can take on this traffic. This is why they exist. Intra-city
>     highways (which Eisenhower opposed) pull traffic away from the grid
>     and concentrate it in a way that makes it impossible for people to
>     develop residencies and/or businesses.
> 2.  **Local Dispersion.** Density of intersections open up possibilities
>     for other modes of transportation like walking, biking, or public
>     transit. Interestingly, when a smaller grid of boulevards are intact
>     and fully utilized, they can carry much more capacity than a
>     highway. This is why Montreal prohibited them in the first place,
>     they found the grid can handle twice the capacity of any highway.
>     And now it’s considered one of the most livable cities in the world.
> 3.  **New Proximities:** When a city successfully builds a rich network
>     for social and economic exchange, the need to travel such long
>     distances for daily tasks falls sharply. Do you want to eat, do
>     dry-cleaning, or see a movie? Just walk down the street. A developed
>     street & block structure can meet most needs and results in a
>     variety of other benefits like saved car expenses, increased safety,
>     better tax-base, and more jobs.
> 
> My own city of Dallas, TX is facing this challenge currently. The
> crumbling stretch of highway dividing Downtown from East Dallas —the
> largest contiguous area of walkable grid — forms a noose around Downtown
> Dallas. It’s dead right now. The city is taking proposals from TxDOT who
> has offered 9 proposals for repairing the highway and none for removing
> it. Luckily we have [Patrick Kennedy](http://www.carfreeinbigd.com/), an
> urban planner that has compiled copious research on this area and is
> beginning an uphill campaign to have a 10th option “considered,” which
> involves removing that portion of the highway. The campaign is called
> “[A New Dallas.](http://anewdallas.com/)”
> 
> While the local data seems like a slam dunk (to me), I find the
> historical examples most powerful because they get around needing to
> answer every little local concern that someone might raise. The examples
> below are well known, but Patrick has culled together quantified data on
> each city in a way that rises above argumentation. His numerous sources
> are listed at the [bottom of this
> page](http://anewdallas.com/research.html).

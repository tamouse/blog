The dubious valuations Wall Street puts on companies is put on the
fire by [Jason Fried](https://medium.com/@jasonfried) of
[Basecamp](http://basecamp.com/) quite wonderfully over at Medium.com:

> In order to determine the valuation of companies, Bhatnagar

> [(Twitter followers x Facebook fans) + (# of employees x 1000)] x
> (total likes + daily page views) + (monthly burn rate x Google’s

> if the CEO has run a business into the ground before. Bhatnagar

> eats it up.”

Well done!

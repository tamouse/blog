> I will never say that progress is being made. If you stick a knife in my back 9 inches and pull it out 6 inches, there's no progress.

> If you pull it all the way out that's not progress.
> The progress is healing the wound that the blow made.
> And they haven't even begun to pull the knife out, much
> less try and heal the wound.

> They won't even admit the knife is there.

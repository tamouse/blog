An interesting design concept.

> Sep 24, 2013

> **the ‘phone+book'** by taiwanese designers at
> [kbme2](http://www.kbme2.com/index.html) makes it possible to
> **easily connect ideas from a digital source, while at the same time
> documenting them by hand.** the phone sits within a cut out slot,
> giving designers, researchers and the like the opportunity to browse
> and source information while directly recording it on
> paper. spontaneous ideas can be immediately jotted down, or
> concentrated sketches copied over. a customized pencil also slots
> within the interior of the book, and can not only be used for
> writing and drawing but also turned upside down and used to scroll
> through the phone. the phone+book is a discreet piece, enabling
> creative ventures during those long meetings when it's important to
> look busy.

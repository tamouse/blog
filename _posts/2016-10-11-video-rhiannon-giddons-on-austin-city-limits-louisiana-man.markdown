Rhiannon Giddens is just **burning** up this song, "Louisiana
Man". She introduces it as a "Mad Love Song" and it certainly is!

There's a great
[Rolling Stone article](http://www.rollingstone.com/country/videos/see-rhiannon-giddens-vicious-louisiana-man-on-acl-w443553)
about the clip as well.

The breakdown and solo trading is awesome, but it just gets immense
during the extended jam at the end, where Rhiannon and 3 of her
sidemen form a close-knit knot and play to each other.

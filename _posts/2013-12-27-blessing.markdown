A prayer for awakening

<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-body">

<blockquote>
May you Awaken to the Mystery of Being here<br />
and enter the quiet immensity of your own presence.<br />
May you have Joy and Peace in the Temple of your Senses.<br />
May you receive great encouragement when new frontiers beckon.<br />
May you respond to the Call of your Gift and find the courage to follow its path.<br />
May the flame of anger free you from falsity.<br />
May warmth of Heart keep your presence aflame and may anxiety never linger about you.<br />
May your outer dignity mirror an inner dignity of Soul.<br />
May you take time to celebrate the quiet miracles that seek no attention.<br />
May you be consoled in the secret symmetry of your Soul.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
May you experience each day as a Sacred Gift woven around the Heart of wonder
</blockquote>

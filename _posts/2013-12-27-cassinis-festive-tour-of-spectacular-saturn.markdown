> This Christmas season, [NASA's Cassini mission got into the festive
> spirit](http://www.ciclops.org/view_event/197/Holiday-Offerings-All-the-Way-from-Saturn),
> capturing some breathtaking views of the beautiful ringed gas giant
> Saturn. Along with Saturn and its majestic rings, views of the Saturnian
> moons Titan, Enceladus and Rhea were also shared, showcasing some of the
> system's most fascinating mysteries such as Titan's south polar vortex,
> ring resonances and Saturn's hexagonal northern jet stream.

I updated my resume at [resume.tamouse.org](http://resume.tamouse.org "Tamara's Resume") again.

Upgraded to [Twitter Bootstrap 3.0](http://getbootstrap.com "Get twitter bootstrap") and used [Frank](https://rubygems.org/gems/frank "Rapidly develop static sites using any supported templatin") instead of driving the site with [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com ) on [Heroku](http://heroku.com ) as it was really slow to come up. It's now being served statically off my Gandi VPS.

I am *still* using YAML to keep the actual contents of the resume, so I can repurpose it into PDF and possibly ODT for those demanding Word format.

> In 1924, air mail pilots were having trouble finding their way across
> the featureless American southwest, so the Post Office adopted a
> brutally low-tech solution: Every 10 miles they built a large concrete
> arrow illuminated by a beacon. Each arrow pointed the way to the next,
> so that a pilot could stay on course simply by connecting the dots.
> 
> The system was finished by 1929, permitting mail planes to find their
> way all the way to San Francisco. It was quickly superseded by more
> sophisticated navigation methods, but today the arrows still dot the
> American desert, ready to confuse hikers and, probably, future
> archaeologists.

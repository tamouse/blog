My teacher is always encouraging us to embrace mistakes with "There is
no such thing as a mistake". I think this is pretty wise teaching, up
to a point. :) There are definitely some things I've done that are not
fixable except by starting over. Yet I don't "bin" the bad painting,
but put it up in the stack with everything else. It's possible its
time has not yet come, or I may find something else that will work; if
nothing else, I can always use the back side of the paper for a value
study or an exercise.

In my time spent consulting with people, one of the phrases I often
used was that there are no mistakes, simply lessons whose teaching has
not yet been fully absorbed.

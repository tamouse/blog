> And what of mistakes? "In the old days, I would have cut off any
  area that was 'wrong,'" Quinn says. "But, in fact, lots of so-called
  errors are easily removed. After all, what's a mistake? These days,
  if I think I've done something wrong, I put the painting away and go
  back to it later rather than binning it. It can be a case of coming
  to terms with something that may not be quite what was intended, but
  is perfectly OK."  
  &mdash; Iain Quinn, Watercolor Artist, June 2014, p. 47

My teacher is always encouraging us to embrace mistakes with "There is no such thing as a mistake". I think this is pretty wise teaching, up to a point. :) There are definitely some things I've done that are not fixable except by starting over. Yet I don't "bin" the bad painting, but put it up in the stack with everything else. It's possible its time has not yet come, or I may find something else that will work; if nothing else, I can always use the back side of the paper for a value study or an exercise.

In my time spent consulting with people, one of the phrases I often used was that there are no mistakes, simply lessons whose teaching has not yet been fully absorbed.

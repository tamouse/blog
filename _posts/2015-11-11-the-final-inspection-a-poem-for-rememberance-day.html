<p>The following poem is attributed several places to one Sgt. Joshua Helterbran, and can be found all over the 'net.
    I found it this day, November 11, 2015, Veteran's Day in the U.S., Armmistice / Rememberance Day in other parts of
    the Commonwealth.</p>

    <h2>"THE FINAL INSPECTION"</h2>

    <p>
        The soldier stood and faced God,<br>
        Which must always come to pass.<br>
        He hoped his shoes were shining,<br>
        Just as brightly as his brass.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        "Step forward now, you soldier,<br>
        How shall I deal with you?<br>
        Have you always turned the other cheek?<br>
        To my Church have you been true?"<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        The soldier squared his soldiers and said,<br>
        "No, Lord, I guess I ain't.<br>
        Because those of us who carry guns,<br>
        Can't always be a saint.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        I've had to work most Sundays,<br>
        And at times my talk was tough.<br>
        And sometimes I've been violent,<br>
        Because the world is awfully rough.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        But, I never took a penny,<br>
        That wasn't mine to keep...<br>
        Though I worked a lot of overtime,<br>
        When the bills just got too steep.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        And I never passed a cry for help,<br>
        Though at times I shook with fear.<br>
        And sometimes, God, forgive me,<br>
        I've wept unmanly tears.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        I know I don't deserve a place,<br>
        Among the people here.<br>
        They never wanted me around,<br>
        Except to calm their fears.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        If you've a place for me here, Lord,<br>
        It needn't be so grand.<br>
        I never expected or had too much,<br>
        But if you don't, I'll understand."<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        There was a silence all around the throne,<br>
        Where the saints had often trod.<br>
        As the soldier waited quietly,<br>
        For the judgement of his God.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        "Step forward now, you soldier,<br>
        You've borne your burdens well.<br>
        Walk peacefully on Heaven's streets,<br>
        You've done your time in Hell."<br>
    </p>

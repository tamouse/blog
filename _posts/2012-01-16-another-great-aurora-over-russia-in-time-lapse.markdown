I **love** time-lapse photography, especially when it comes to Earth and Milky Way movies. This was shot in 2012 during the (then) height of the biggest aurora borealis show in recent years.

> I spent a week capturing one of the biggest aurora borealis shows in recent years.

> Shot in and around Kirkenes and Pas National Park bordering Russia, at 70 degree north and 30 degrees east. Temperatures around -25 Celsius. Good fun.

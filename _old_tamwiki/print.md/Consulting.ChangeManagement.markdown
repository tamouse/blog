**Change Management**, or **Managing Organizational Change**, deals with
the issues surrounding changes in organizations, whether to install a
new tool or process, to a reorganization, to a downsizing. It covers the
gammut of how changes affect individuals in organizations, and how to
swiftly and (relatively) easily move an organization through a change to
a positive, working, desired future state.

Change Management is one of the areas I consult in a lot, and it is part
of every consulting effort I've ever encountered. Humans, as a lot, are
averse to changes imposed upon them.

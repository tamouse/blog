"The best things in life are free. Love and happiness cannot be bought
or sold by anyone, no matter how rich they are. No amount of money can
purchase any thing as pure and wonderful as love, for money is man made.
Love is a gift that everyone has been given. No one can buy the feeling
of happiness. No person can manufacture love, put it into a box and sell
it in a store. Love is special in a way that we humans cannot
understand. Life itself cannot be purchased, for it is given to us
without price. You may buy something and think it is the greatest thing
in the world, but sooner or later that object will be gone. You can
always go out and buy something new, but in time it to will perish. Even
after the you're gone your love will remain in the people whom you most
cherished. We may always have affection for objects, but they will never
be the best things in life. "

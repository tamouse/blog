This recipe looks so simple, and looks so NOMMY! It originally came from
"Cooking with Julia" and was posted at
<http://www.foodbuzz.com/blogs/5229627-irish-soda-bread>. This will be
my first foray into baking something more complex than drop biscuits,
cake or cookies. This looks easy enough that I'm sure it will turn out!

<span id="ingredients"></span>

Ingredients
-----------

-   4 Cups Flour
-   1 teaspoon baking soda
-   1 1/2 teaspoons salt
-   2 cups Buttermilk *(or [sour
    milk](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Recipes.SouringMilk?action=print))*

<span id="directions"></span>

Directions
----------

1.  Preheat oven to 375â„‰. Make sure to position your rack in the middle
    of the oven.

2.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This way you don??t have
    to grease a pan. You can just put the dough right onto the sheet.
    Set this aside.

3.  In a large bowl put together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir
    together with a fork until all ingredients are incorporated. Add the
    buttermilk and stir vigorously until the dough comes together.

4.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface (keep some extra
    flour handy this dough is VERY sticky). Knead the dough gently for a
    minute. Do not knead too much! The dough should be soft and
    malleable.

5.  Pat the dough into a disk about 6 inches across and slash and X
    across the top of the dough. The X should be about 1/2 an inch deep.
    I know that seems a bit deep, but do it, you will see what it does
    when it bakes. Place the dough onto the baking sheet.

6.  Bake the dough for about 50 minutes or until the dough is golden
    brown on top. Transfer it to a rack to cool for a few minutes and
    then slice. Serve warm.

Now, because of the low fat content in the bread it doesn??t last very
long. Will be as hard as a blarney stone in 2 days so make sure if you
make this you plan on eating all of it, or plan on throwing some out for
your birds to enjoy . I have found that if you put it away immediately
after dinner (possibly while still a little warm), it will last about 2
days. That 3rd day though? Forget it!

This will be my first foray into baking, when I make this. I'm looking
forward to it!

Lovingkindness Metta
====================

<span id="excerpt"></span> The Buddhist Metta of Loving Kindness has a
long and rich tradition. It is brought into practice to keep the mind
open and fruitful. It's purpose is to develop a sense of selflessness
and practice altruism, as was taught by the Buddha. <span
id="excerptend"></span>

The basic concept is that hatred cannot coexist with a sense of loving
kindness; one drives out the other. So to practice giving loving
kindness, one can dispell a sense of hatred. Loving kindness is not
forgiveness, although they are somewhat related, and practicing loving
kindness can lead one to forgiveness.

There are many things which cause one to have negative states;
practicing a positive state can help relieve one of those negative
feelings.

The Method of the Prayer
------------------------

To perform this prayer, one must thing of other people, and make the
prayer to them each in turn. Some of the people to think of include:

-   Yourself
-   Your parents
-   Your siblings
-   Other relations
-   Those you work with and for
-   Those you play with
-   Those you are in community with
-   Those who give you guidance and support
-   Those who contest with you
-   Those who might be your enemies
-   The entire world

Clearly, this goes from small to huge. How does one possibly think of
the entire world? Actually, it isn't necessarily that difficult a thing
to conceptualize that all people everywhere can benefit from loving
kindness. Perhaps a more difficult set of people to think of this way
are your supposed enemies. How can you justify wishing loving kindness
for them? Yet this is the way of achieving true detachment and grace,
and to achieve a truly loving, kind heart.

To do this, recite the metta substituting the person or people or group
for the tag \<person\> in the script below. Start from the center,
yourself, and work your way out to the last group "all beings", the
reverse the flow back to yourself. You may speak it to individuals,
groups, or whatever you wish that signifies the recipient of your loving
kindness.

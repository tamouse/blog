James P Kelly's "Burn" short sf novel podcast concludes
-------------------------------------------------------

Tuesday, February 28, 2006

by **Cory Doctorow** via [Boing!Boing!](http://www.boingboing.com/):

<div class="vspace">

</div>

<div class="indent">

The entirety of Burn, a wonderful short science fiction novel, is now
available as an audiobook podcast.
<div class="vspace">

</div>

</div>

<div class="indent">

Back in November, I blogged about Hugo-award-winning author James
Patrick Kelly's podcasting of his new short novel Burn, one chapter per
week, for sixteen weeks.
<div class="vspace">

</div>

</div>

<div class="indent">

Burn is the story of Prosper Gregory Leung, a native of a
techno-primitive utopian planet called Walden, a planet that was
purchased by a wealthy industrialist who turned it into a primitivist
state modeled on Thoreau's book, chasing off the Pukpuks, the original
settlers whose industrial civilization had denuded the planet's native
flora and fauna. The Waldeners sign onto a covenant to eschew most
technology -- including all the amazing, life-extending,
faster-than-light magic of the universe outside of Walden -- except for
genetically modified fast-growing forests that they use to replant the
world, remaking it into a verdant and tranquil paradise.
<div class="vspace">

</div>

</div>

<div class="indent">

But the Pukpuks aren't all content to be driven away. Some of them take
to the hills, and attack Walden's forests and towns with firebombs that
create the Burn, an ongoing, raging fire-fight that licks at the world's
vegetation.
<div class="vspace">

</div>

</div>

<div class="indent">

Leung is a firefighter, a kind of paramilitary role in this world, who
has lost his best friend in a Pukpuk attack, and who is recovering in a
high-tech hospital where he experiments with a souped up galactic phone
that puts him in touch with the High Gregory, a kind of reincarnated
Dalai Llama, but weirder and less tranquil, who surprises Leung by
showing up with his entourage of prepubescent incarnations of divine
powers to "make luck for him."
<div class="vspace">

</div>

</div>

<div class="indent">

Like all Jim Kelly stories, Burn wrenches at your heart even as it makes
you laugh out loud. I learned everything I know about reading aloud from
attending Jim Kelly's readings at science fiction conventions (and he
says he learned all he knows from reading to his kids, who are
apparently a discriminating audience) and listening to him read Burn is
a positive delight. One of my weekly highlights for the past
four-or-so-months has been the latest Burn installment, and Jim's
wonderful, warm readings of his book. I can't recommend it enough, and
now that it's completed, it's the perfect thing to load onto a CD or MP3
player for a long trip or a week's worth of bike rides or workouts at
the gym. [Podcast feed

*A doomed lord, an emergent hero, and a dazzling array of bizarre
creatures inhabit the magical world of the Gormenghast novels which,
along with Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, reign as one of the undisputed
fantasy classics of all time. At the center of it all is the
seventy-seventh Earl, Titus Groan, who stands to inherit the miles of
rambling stone and mortar that form Gormenghast Castle and its kingdom,
unless the conniving Steerpike, who is determined to rise above his
menial position and control the House of Groan, has his way.*

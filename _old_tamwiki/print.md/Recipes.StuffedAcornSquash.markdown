2.  Cut the squash in half, scooping out the seeds. Then scoop out and
    save more of the squash to make room for stuffing.

3.  Heat oil/butter/spray in a pan over medium heat. When hot, put in
    the onions, celery and carrots, and cook until the onion turns
    translucent, a few minutes.

7.  Cover the whole pan with foil and bake for 45 minutes, or until the
    squash is soft (larger squash will take longer).

This is great alone, but even better with a sauce over the top. A light
cheese sauce or a meat gravy such as turkey gravy will go very well on
top of this.

In contrast to <span
class="wikiword">[BakedNachos](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Recipes.BakedNachos?action=print)</span>,
this is a much simpler recipe, good for those munchie emergencies.
Seriously, the longest bit of time for this recipe is probably shredding
the cheese if you don't buy it pre-shredded. These make for a serious
quick snack fix good for watching TV.

Ingredients
-----------

-   can of chili (I prefer Hormel Turkey Chili with Beans, but use your
    own favourite)
-   4 oz shredded cheese (cheddar is good, can mix with monterey jack or
    pepper jack as well)
-   8 oz tortilla chips
-   salsa or pico de gallo, whatever you have on hand

Directions
----------

1.  Line the bottom of a microwave-safe dish or plate with tortilla
    chips
2.  Cover with cheese
3.  Drop the chili at various strategic points on the chips
4.  Similarly drop the salsa on the chips. It's important not to get too
    much chili or salsa on the chips as they makes them soggy (unless
    you like that, of course!)
5.  Moar cheeze!
6.  Microwave for about 3 minutes

These can be layered if you don't go to heavy on any layer. If you don't
have chili, you can do without for just some cheesy chips.

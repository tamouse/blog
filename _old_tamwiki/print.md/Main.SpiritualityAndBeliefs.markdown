<span id="excerpt"></span> I don't espouse any particular religion or
set of beliefs. I am most closely allied with atheism in that I have a
hard time believing in supernatural things, or for their ability to
affect things physically if they do exist, so they are largely
irrelevant to me. There are things which I do think relate to
spirituality and beliefs, however, which are important to me and
possibly to others. I have derived great benefit from practices of
meditation and some kinds of prayer. While I don't necessarily believe
that my prayers actually affect anyone else directly, they do affect me,
and in turn, I can affect others. <span id="excerptend"></span>

Here are some things I've captured dealing with Sprirituality and
Beliefs.

Prayers
-------

### Serenity Prayer, expanded

God, Grant me:

-   **Clarity**, amidst confusion
-   **Hope**, amidst despair
-   **Faith**, in the world and in myself
-   **Serenity** to accept that which I cannot change
-   **Courage** to change the things I can
-   and the **Wisdom** to know the difference

### Serenity Prayer, **revised**

Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,\
The courage to change the person I can\
And the wisdom to know that person is **me**.

### Morning Prayer

I open my ears That I may hear the wisdom of my ancestors.\
I open my eyes that I may see with vision and clarity.\
I open my mouth that I may speak with gentle intelligence and
compassion.\
I open my heart that I may love and be loved.\
I open my arms to receive the bountiful gifts of the [Universe].\
Blessed be this day.

The first one I heard:
----------------------

<div class="round lrindent quote" style="font-size: 110%;">

"It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion.\
It is by the beans of Java that thoughts acquire speed,\
The hands acquire shakes, the shakes become a warning.\
It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion."

</div>

Here's another:
---------------

<div class="round lrindent quote" style="font-size: 110%;">

It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion.

The beans become a grind, the grind becomes a shot,\
the shot acquires a cr??ma, water becomes steam,\
the milk acquires a froth.

I will turn the inner eye to the path of the caffeine,\
and where it has passed there will be only vigorous neuron activity.

It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion.

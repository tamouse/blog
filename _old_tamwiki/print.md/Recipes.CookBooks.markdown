-   The Joy of Cooking - if you can get an older edition of this,
    they're better (my Mother's is from 1952, and it's really great.
    There was an edition put out in the 80's or 90's, I think, that has
    been depricated. A new edition is out now that returns to the
    quality of the original.)
-   Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking - a classic
-   Jane Brody's Good Food Book
-   The New Moosewood Cookbook
-   Sunset Magazine's Favourite Recipes
-   Betty Rossbottom's Sunday Soups

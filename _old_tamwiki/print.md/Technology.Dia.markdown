In this post I’m going to give a quick how-to on creating database
schemas with a wonderful tool called Dia. I’ve often found having a nice
visual representation of a database to be quite helpful but can’t stand
keeping it up to date. As soon as you add a new column or change the
design around you end up having to sync your visual diagram with your
SQL files. It’s tedious having to manage the various SQL for building
the database and this can be a larger pain when trying to support
different database platforms each with their own SQL syntax. So before
you create your next database read on and see how Dia can make your life
a bit easier.

Dia is a program for creating diagrams and for this exercise we’ll be
creating UML diagrams from within Dia. We’re also going to use a perl
script called tedia2sql which will transform our Dia files directly to
SQL for our target database. What’s also nice about creating database
schemas this way is that you can generate SQL for multiple target
databases without the maintenance overhead.

Summary:Dia is a diagramming tool in GNOME (GNU/Linux desktop) that is
somewhat comparable to Microsoft's Visio and Omnigroup's Omnigraffle.

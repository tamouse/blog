1.  Combine the flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl and mix to
    combine. Add the water and herbs, if using, and mix well. The dough
    will be very sticky and shaggy-looking. Cover the bowl with plastic
    wrap and set aside at room temperature for 18 to 24 hours.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

2.  Generously flour a work surface. The dough will have risen and will
    be covered in bubbles. Transfer the dough to the work surface and
    dust it with flour. Fold the dough in half, and then form the dough
    into a ball by stretching and tucking the edges of the dough
    underneath the ball.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

3.  Liberally flour a kitchen towel (do not use terrycloth). Place the
    dough ball on the floured towel. Cover with another floured towel.
    Let the dough rise for about two hours (see [footnote](#note001)).
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

4.  Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place a lidded
    Dutch oven or deep heavy duty casserole dish (with lid) into the
    oven to preheat.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

5.  Carefully remove the hot baking dish from the oven. Remove the lid
    and gently turn the dough ball into the ungreased baking dish,
    seam-side up; shake the dish so the dough is more evenly
    distributed.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

6.  Cover and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and bake until the
    crust is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the loaf from the
    baking dish and let it cool on a rack before slicing.

<span id="toc3"></span>Editor's Note
------------------------------------

<span id="note001"></span> To ensure the dough is fully risen and ready
for the oven, do the Poke Test: flour your index and middle fingers, and
poke the side of your loaf about half an inch deep. If the indentations
spring back, the dough still needs more time to rise. When the
indentations stay put, the loaf is ready to bake. <span

I've been baking no-knead bread ever since the original recipe came out
in the New York Times several years ago, so trust me when I tell you it
is not recommended that you remove the baking vessel from the oven after
you've just spent 30 minutes heating it. Do NOT remove it from the oven,
just pour the dough (batter, really) into the baking vessel and then
cover and bake. That way you don't lose the heat you just spent half an
hour to achieve to heat the pan. Also, there's no need to shake the
dough once it's in the pan, it'll spread by itself while baking. It's
really a misnomer to call this a dough, because it really comes out as a
batter. I agree with the other reviewer that it's impossible to form it
into any kind of a ball 'cause it's just too sticky. And forget the step
of placing it on a towel to raise. It's just messy and doesn't achieve
anything more than if you just stir it and place it in a bowl and let it
rise another 2 hours. That said, I would rate this a 4, only because I
think the instructions are not the best way to make this bread.

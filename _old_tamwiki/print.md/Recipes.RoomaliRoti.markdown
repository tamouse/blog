Directions
----------

1.  In a large bowl, sift together flour and salt. Add oil and mix in
    with a fork until flour is crumbly. Mix in water until the dough
    pulls together. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and
    knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Cover and set aside
    for 45 minutes.

2.  Knead dough again until smooth; divide into six equal parts. Form
    each part into a round. Roll out each round as thinly as possible;
    dust with flour to keep from sticking.

    pan and cook. Roti will cook in 40 to 50 seconds. Tiny black spots
    will appear when it is finished. Fold Roti and serve hot.

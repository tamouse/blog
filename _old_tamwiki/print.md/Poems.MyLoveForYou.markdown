My Love For You
===============

I hear your name, it lights my way\
You're what I miss, I won't feel the same\
Until you're walking with me

We've come a long way, but we're not too sure\
We've been on the path, feel like we walked so long\
Strolled hand in hand with love

I need someone to hold, a special kind of something\
Nobody said that I would feel this pain\
When I'm all alone, I've got something to give

I am thinking of you in my sleepless solitude\
I'd risk my life to feel your body next to mine\
Babe can you feel me, imagine I'm looking in your eyes

Sometimes you don't expect that friends can become lovers\
So hold me close and don't let go, 'cause this is love, boy\
And we are gonna be together for eternity, its with you I belong\
Because I'm in love with you, this is love

I'll be loving you forever deep inside my heart\
There is no-one in this world who can love me like you do\
So many reasons that I want to spend my life forever with you

If we love each other, we wont go that way\
So put aside your doubts do what it takes to make it right\
'cause I love you forever, no-one can tear us apart

You are my life and you're the last thing on my mind\
Before I go to sleep at night, your always around\
When I need you, when trouble is on my mind

I love you eternally

### Ponzu Sauce

Directions
----------

1.  In a 10-inch sauté pan, heat oil on medium. Let pan get hot, until
    the oil shimmers. Add the chicken and sauté for about 2 minutes,
    until almost done cooking. (If using shrimp, cook until the flesh is
    just pink.) Stir in water chestnuts, green onions and oyster sauce.
    Taste and add salt if necessary. Transfer to bowl and let cool in
    the refrigerator. (Mixture must be entirely cool before you fill the
    wrappers.)

2.  Scoop a teaspoon of filling into center of a wonton wrapper. Paint
    the edges of the wrapper with the egg and cornstarch mixture, which
    acts as a "glue" to keep the dumpling sealed.

3.  Fold wrapper on a diagonal, forming a triangle. To seal wrapper,
    start from one corner and slowly press your way all around. Avoid
    trapping air inside. Repeat with all wrappers. Set dumplings aside.

4.  Bring a 2-quart pot of water to a boil. Drop in a few dumplings at a
    time. They will sink to bottom, and as soon as they float, they're
    done. Pull them out with a slotted spoon and drain them on a plate.
    Don't use paper towels on the plate because they will stick to the
    dumplings. Wipe plate of excess water.

5.  In a small bowl, combine vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, orange juice and
    ginger to make ponzu sauce. Serve dumplings with sauce on side.

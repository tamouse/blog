Are these the End Times?
------------------------

A witch? A satanist? Possessed? Gifted? Used of God? Whatever you say,
the evidence certainly suggests Mother Shipton was the closest thing to
a prophetess that England had for many generations. Of her lfe we know
some, not much. Mother Shipton, sometimes called "the Yorkshire Sybil"
was reputedly born Ursula Sontheil (or Southill) in 1488 in Norfolk,
England (supposedly in the cave of Knaresborough), and died in 1561. Her
mother Agatha was well known for her exceptional powers. Ursula, too,
exhibited prophetic and psychic abilities from an early age. At 24,
married to one Toby Shipton, she eventually became known as Mother
Shipton. Many of her visions came true within her own lifetime and in
subsequent centuries. I first learned of her through an old time holy
roller preacher, Bishop Whitlock, in Lewiston, California. But with all
the <span
class="wikiword">[Y2K](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Main.Y2K?action=edit)[?](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Main.Y2K?action=edit)</span>
hoopla, her fame seems enigmatically to be spreading. These rare verses
from Mother Shipton seem to have prophetic indications for our times,
and while open to interpretation, they show this woman to have been
uncannily prescient.

"This was given to Laurent under the Tree in Athens, Georgia by Tim
Mills in October, 1944. From an article in the Banner-Herald, Athens, GA
Monday, May 23, 1938: We are in receipt of an alleged prophecy written
five hundred years ago by Mother Shipton and vouched for by J.H.
Phillips, of Ashdown, Arkansas. Many of the prophecies have come true
and on the suggestion of the owner of the copy of the prophecy, we are
giving space to its publication."

A Prophecy from half a millenium ago
------------------------------------

So timely it's almost spooky

Some people seem to believe the prophetic age passed with the Apostles.
Here is a prophecy written 500 years ago by a woman. Read and see if you
can suggest how she could have improved it if she had written it this
month. Before reading it, please undertake to transport yourself back
across five centuries and live when there were no steamships, no steam
railways, no sewing machines, no cook stoves, no radios, no automobiles,
no flying machines, no submarines, and none of the many other inventions
so common today.

Now, you back there, sitting alone in your quaint old fashioned
dwelling, READ this poem AND SEE if you do not think she had a real
vision of the future happenings of the world.

Mother Shipton was born in Norfolk England and died in Clifton,
Yorkshire, 1449. Thus you see she died 43 years before Columbus
discovered America. - J.H. Phillips, Ashdown AR.

Mother Shipton Prophecy (Poem)
------------------------------

<span style="font-size:83%">*Archaic spelling has been
modernized*</span>

A carriage without horse shall go;\
Disasters fill the world with woe.\
In London, Primrose Hill shall be,\
Its centre hold a Bishop's See.\
Around the world men's thoughts shall fly\
Quick as the twinkling of an eye\
And waters shall great wonders do,\
How strange, and yet it shall come true.

Then upside down the world shall be,\
And gold found at the root of tree;\
Through towering hill proud men shall ride,\
No horse nor ass move at his side.\
Beneath the waters men shall walk;\
Shall ride, shall sleep and even talk.\
And in the air men shall be seen,\
In white and black and even green.\
A great man then shall come and go,\
For prophecy declares it so.

In water iron then shall float\
As easy as a wooden boat,\
Gold shall be found in stream or stone,\
In land that is as yet unknown.\
Water and fire shall wonders do,\
And England shall admit a Jew.

The Jew that once was held in scorn,\
Shall of a Christian then be born. [borne?]\
A house of glass shall come to pass\
In ENGLAND - but alas!\
A war will follow with the work,\
Where dwells the pagan and the Turk.\
The states will lock in fiercest strife\
And seek to take each other's life.\
When North shall thus divide South\
The eagle build in lion's mouth.\
Then tax and blood and cruel war\
Shall come to every humble door.

Three times shall lovely sunny France\
Be lead to play a lovely dance,\
Before the people shall be free.\
The tyrant rulers shall she see.\
Three rulers in succession be,\
Each sprang from different dynasty.

Then, when fiercest fight is done\
England and France shall be as one.\
The British olive next shall twine\
In marriage with the German vine.\
Men walk beneath and over streams\
Fulfilled shall be our strangest dreams.

All England's sons that plough the land -\
Shall oft be seen with Book in hand.\
The poor shall then True Wisdom know\
And waters, wind, where corn did grow.\
Great houses stand in farflung vale,\
All covered o'er with snow and hail.

And now a word in uncouth rhyme\
Of what shall be in future time,\
For in the wondrous far off days,\
The women shall adopt a craze\
To dress like men and trousers wear\
And cut off their lovely locks of hair.

They'll ride astride with brazen brow\
As witches on a broomstick now\
Then love shall die and marriage cease,\
And nations wane as babies decrease.\
The wives shall fondle cats and dogs\
And men live much the same as hogs.

In nineteen-hundred twentysix\
Build houses light of straw and sticks,

And roaring monsters with man atop\
Do seem to eat the verdant crop.\
And men shall fly as birds do now,\
And give away the horse and plough.\
When pictures live with movements free,\
When boats like fishes swim the sea,\
When men like birds shall scour the sky\
Then half the world, blood drenched shall die.

For then shall mighty war be planned\
and fire and sword sweep the land.\
But those who live the century through\
In fear and trembling this will do;\
Flee to the mountains and the dens\
To bog and forest and wild fens\
For storms shall rage and oceans roar,\
when Gabriel stands on sea and shore\
And when he blows his horn\
Old worlds shall die and new be born.

<span id="excerpt"></span> Emacs has been my text editor of choice since
probably about 1985 or so when I first started working on unix systems.
I had come from using the screen editing capabilities of old HP
terminals that were able to buffer up the contents of their screens and
send it all at once to the computer they were attached to. Emacs
represented the first departure for me from that where the editing was
actually being done directly on the computer upstream from the terminal.

As such, Emacs is the editor I "imprinted" on and as such it is the one
I use to judge my experience of all other editors. Time and again, I've
tried different text editors only to go back to Emacs. My most recent
departures from Emacs have been using Eclipse at a job where I was
writing Java, and TextMate on OS X which I used extensively in my web
development work. I have been doing the majority of my work on my
macbook pro, and so TextMate was quite a natural choice, although I
still did some work in Emacs on the mbp as well.

Now, I'm switching back to Linux-based development for the most part, so
TextMate is right out in that regard, so it's back my beloved Emacs
again.

Here are some things I've been recently getting into Emacs to make my
develoment experience better. There are some really nifty features of
TextMate that aren't built directly into Emacs in the standard
distribution configuration.

<span id="fn1_1"></span>^1^ 500℉ was *way* to hot for our oven; I
reduced the temp to 400℉ which was much better. [⇑](#fnr1_1)

<span id="fn1_2"></span>^2^ I don't bother letting the potatoes cool. I
prepare everything else while the pototoes are baking. [⇑](#fnr1_2)

Variations
----------

I added sautéed fresh mushrooms, cooked in a little bit of the bacon
drippings.

It's perfectly okay to use a couple of green onions instead of the
chives.

For extra zest, you can add italian herbs, paprika or what-have-you to
both the potatoes and the egg mixture (just don't overdo it!).

This is a pretty standard recipe, nothing really special going on here,
but split pea soup is one of those wonderful wintery soups. Thick,
delicious, and heartwarming.

Comments
--------

The first time I made this, I used a couple of smoked ham hocks and made
the broth from that (see <span
class="wikiword">[HomeMadeStock](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Recipes.HomeMadeStock?action=print)</span>).
While this made great broth, I would not generally recommend using ham
hocks in the soup, though, as there is a considerable amount of fat on a
ham hock, and we were left with hardly any meat for the soup.

I use and have used many different operating systems over the years.
Currently I use mostly Unix-based OSen: OS/X, Linux, BSD, Android. I
feel extremely comfortable with these types of operating systems. I have
used Windows as an end user, but have never written any applications for
Windows beyond a few I wrote way back in Windows 3.1 and 3.11 days.
These days, most of my work is in
[WebDevelopment](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Technology.WebDevelopment?action=edit)[?](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Technology.WebDevelopment?action=edit)
which is almost exclusively on GNU/Linux systems (although different
distributions).

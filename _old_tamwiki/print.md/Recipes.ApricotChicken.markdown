This is a quick and easy main dish, something I sort of whipped up on
the spur of the moment.

<span id="ingredients"></span>

Ingredients
-----------

-   3 small or 2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cubed
-   salt and pepper
-   other seasoning as desired (I used Monterey Chicken Spice Blend)
-   1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms, or 1 small can sliced mushroom
    pieces, drained
-   1/4 cup apricot preserves
-   1/4 cup Gew??rtztraminer
-   2 tablespoons tamari sauce
-   1 tablespoon sesame oil

Directions
----------

1.  Spray a skillet with vegetable oil coating (or use 1 tablespoon
    olive oil or the like).

2.  If using fresh mushrooms, saut√© them in butter or olive oil until
    they release their liquid, about 3 minutes. Set aside.

3.  Over medium heat, saut?? the chicken, adding the salt, pepper and
    spices.

4.  As the chicken nears done, add in the mushrooms, apricot preserves,
    tamari sauce and sesame oil.

5.  If the sauce is too thin, sprinkle in a **little** flour to thicken
    it.

Serve over fresh greens or with rice or other grain accompaniment.

Everyone who reads this (and other recipes I use canned mushrooms in)
says "I'd use real mushrooms." Well, yes, you certainly can. I might too
if I remember to buy them and use them. Canned ones mean I don't have to
worry about fresh ones going bad, or going to the store when I want to
make this.

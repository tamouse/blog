<span id="fn1_1"></span>^1^ I have variously tried: dried mustard, wet
mustard, basil, oregano, ginger, chili powder, ketchup, bbq sauce, or
whatever I feel the urge to toss in. Some of these have met with more or
less success. [⇑](#fnr1_1)

<span id="fn1_2"></span>^2^ it wouldn't be a hot dish without cream of
mushroom soup! [⇑](#fnr1_2)

<span id="fn1_3"></span>^3^ I recently did this with frozen sweet potato
fries and it came out quite nice. [⇑](#fnr1_3)

<span id="fn1_4"></span>^4^ Sometimes, I've carmelised the onions first,
depending on how much time I have. [⇑](#fnr1_4)

I love oven-roasted vegetables. They bring a distinctive flavour to
salads and other dishes, as well as being great as an accompaniment to a
main dish.

This recipe came from somewhere, and as I read it over, it seems pretty
rigid. Feel free to let loose with pretty much anything.

<span id="fn1_1"></span>^1^ There is something about balsamic vinegar
that seems essential for roasted veggies. [⇑](#fnr1_1)

<span id="fn1_2"></span>^2^ One of the key herbs to use here is
Rosemary. It is usually included in Italian Seasoning, but if you don't
have that, a good mixture of Rosemary, Marjoram, Parsley, Sage, Thyme,
Basil and/or Oregano is good. [⇑](#fnr1_2)

<span id="fn1_3"></span>^3^ This gets easier if you just put the oil,
vinegar, spices and veggies in a big ziplock bag and shake it well
before putting on the baking pan. [⇑](#fnr1_3)

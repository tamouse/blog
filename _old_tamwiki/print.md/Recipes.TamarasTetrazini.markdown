The basic recipe here started with a recipe from a Sunset magazine
cookbook, Favorite Recipes. I've modified since then.

1.  In a pan, spray with oil if desired (I often cook this dish with no
    oil whatsoever), cook garlic, chicken and mushroom pieces, seasoning
    chicken pieces with the monterey spice blend. After the chicken has
    cooked a bit, add the white wine.

Comments
--------

When I'm making this for other people, which is often, I don't put in
the thai chili sauce. I just do that for me. It makes things really pop.

Variations
----------

I've heard that some recipes for tetrazini call for some kind of nuts,
such as slivered almonds or something like that. I may have to try that,
but I'm not sure at which stage to add them.

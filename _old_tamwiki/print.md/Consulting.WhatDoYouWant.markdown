<div id="wikitext">

<span id="excerpt"></span> Perhaps the most important question one can
ever ask, either of others or of one's self. Understanding what we want
is key to getting what we want. The more specific we are, the more
likely we are to get it. <span id="excerptend"></span>

The <span
class="wikiword">[ThreeGoldenQuestions](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Consulting.ThreeGoldenQuestions?action=print)</span>
and the <span
class="wikiword">[RestOfTheQuestions](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Consulting.RestOfTheQuestions?action=print)</span>
build upon this basic question.

The intention of this question is to get as complete a picture of the
client's <span
class="wikiword">[DesiredState](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Consulting.DesiredState?action=print)</span>
as possible. Having the <span
class="wikiword">[DesiredState](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Consulting.DesiredState?action=print)</span>
specified in <span
class="wikiword">[SensoryInformation](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Consulting.SensoryInformation?action=print)</span>
details helps the client to step into the <span
class="wikiword">[DesiredState](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Consulting.DesiredState?action=print)</span>
and try it on to see if they like it. It also establishes a set of
anchors and criteria they can use to remember what they want when they
are in the midst of getting it (remember: "When you're up to your neck
in aligators, don't forget that the mission was to drain the swamp").

Alternative ways of asking the same question
--------------------------------------------

-   What do you need at this point?
-   What would you like to have instead?
-   When you don't have X , what will you have?
-   What is the outcome you want?
-   Tell me how you'd like this to all end up.

And asking from the *future* desired state:

-   When you have everything working well, what do you have? *(from the
    future looking back.)*
-   Imagine you now have what it is you want. Can you tell me what that
    is?
-   Put yourself out in time to when you have what you want. What was
    that?
-   What do you have now, in the future when you have it, that you
    wanted?

These last set of question require a sort of [*sleight of
mouth*](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Consulting.SleightOfMouth?action=edit)[?](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Consulting.SleightOfMouth?action=edit) --
the way they sound to client is important, because they are not very
straight-forward syntax-wise, nor in a way most people talk or think.
You may need to gently pace your client before you get to such a
question.

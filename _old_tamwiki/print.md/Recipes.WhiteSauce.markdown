Learning to make a good white sauce isn't hard. White sauce is the basis
for many other kinds of sauces and should be mastered with relative
ease.

3.  keeping the heat on, slowly add the milk, continuously whisking.
    This is the tricky part, you can add the milk too fast and the sauce
    won't thicken well or properly.

4.  keep whisking until the sauce begins to thicken. At this point it is
    ready for other treatments.

White sauce is so easy to make, there's little to no point in making it
up ahead of time and keeping it. Besides, I'm not even sure that would
work. The longer it sits, the thicker it gets until it becomes paste.

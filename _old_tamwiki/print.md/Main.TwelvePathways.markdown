The Twelve Pathways To the Higher Consciousness Planes of Unconditional Love and Oneness
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Freeing Myself
--------------

1.  I am Freeing Myself from security, sensation, and power addictions
    that make me try to forcefully control situations in my life, and
    thus destroy my serenity and keep me from loving myself and others.
2.  I am discovering how my consciousness-dominating addictions create
    my illusory version of the changing world of people and situations
    around me.
3.  I welcome the opportunity (even if painful) that my minute-to-minute
    experience offers me to become aware of the addictions I must
    reprogram to be liberated from my robot-like emotional patterns.

### Being Here Now

1.  I always remember that I have everything I need to enjoy my here and
    now -- unless I am letting my consciousness be dominated by demands
    and expectation based on the dead past or the imagined future.
2.  I take full responsibility here and now for everything I experience,
    for it is my own programming that creates my actions and also
    influences the reaction of people around me.
3.  I accept myself completely here and now and consciously experience
    everything I feel, think, say, and do (including my emotion-backed
    addictions) as a necessary part of my growth into higher
    consciousness.

### Interacting With Others

1.  I open myself genuinely to all people by being willing to fully
    communicate my deepest feelings, since hiding in any degree keeps me
    stuck in my illusion of separteness from other people.
2.  I feel with loving compassion the problems of others without getting
    caught up emotionally in their predicaments that are offering them
    messages they need for their growth.
3.  I act freely when I am tuned in, centered, and loving, but if
    possible I avoid acting when I am emotionally upset and depriving
    myself of the wisdom that flows from love and expanded
    consciousness.

### Dicovering My Counscious-Awareness

1.  I am continually calming the restless scanning of my rational mind
    in order to perceive the finer energies that enable me to unitively
    merge with everything around me.
2.  I am constantly aware of which of the <span
    class="wikiword">[SevenCentersOfConsciousness](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Main.SevenCentersOfConsciousness?action=print)</span>
    I am using, and I feel my energy, perceptiveness, Love and inner
    peace growing as I open all the [Centers of
    Consciousness](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Main.SevenCentersOfConsciousness?action=print).
3.  I am perceiving everyone, including myself, as an awakening being
    who is here to claim his or her birthright to the higher
    consciousness planes of unconditional love and oneness.

Skippy's D&D Dwarf List
-----------------------

January 4th, 2006

<span style="font-size:83%">(originally posted at
<http://redvsblue.com/members/journal/entry.php?id=685572>, but
presented here without all the stupid proprietary "smart
quotes".)</span>

Things Skippy the Dwarf Fighter has learned or been told while dungeon
delving, or is no longer allowed to do while delving. Dwarf Snorri
Snorrison son of Snorrison's son ('Skippy' to friends and enemies
alike), has been a party member of the "Lost Empire" campaign for
several years. His adventuring behavior has been corrected from time to
time, for not being appropriate for a dungeon delve. The list is almost
entirely composed of The Word he was given as a response to an action or
event he was involved with.

1.  After the "Dark Vessel" adventure, everyone who ever loved me is
    dead. I'm not allowed to brag about that anymore.
2.  Aftershave is not to be applied with a putty knife.
3.  Although I do think I could do a better job and I would like to
    lead, these questions usually turn out not to be sincere.
4.  Anything I say after "it's worth noting" is usually not interesting
    to anyone else in the party.
5.  Basilisks cannot be hypnotized by winning a staring contest with
    them.
6.  Battle axes are not the sniper's weapon of choice so I should get
    off the roof and engage the enemy.
7.  Battle axes don't have a stun setting.
8.  Clerics can move in all directions, not just diagonally.
9.  Clerics that are dragged to a tavern for a night of celebratory
    quaffing should be returned to their devotions within 4 to 6 working
    days (or within two High Holy Days, whichever comes first).
10. Dark Gods require virgin sacrifices; incantations do not require
    virgin spell components. It is wrong to ask the mage how he knows
    his frog's eyes come from a virgin frog.
11. Draft horses are not missile weapons.
12. Dragon breath is not funny.
13. Dragons do not dispense their hoard in lotteries, and there's no way
    I "may already be a winner."
14. 'Dropping Trou" is not a fighter class "special attack."
15. Elf ears do not require sharpening.
16. For all that he's an illiterate man, the seneschal can read me like
    a book.
17. For customs inspectors, "Declare" has a specific meaning that does
    not involve reciting my heritage back to the "Time Of Troubles."
18. Get down off the altar.
19. Gifts from The Gods do not come with an exchange coupon for Harrod's
    Mercantile and Chandler shop.
20. God-calls are not protected as Free Speech.
21. He did not "start it."
22. He is not kidding.
23. He is not on "my side of the dungeon."
24. He really means it this time.
25. Holy Relics of Fantastic Power do not have a shelf-life date.
26. "Hungry" is not an alignment.
27. Neither is "stupid," but in my case, they're willing to make an
    exception.
28. I am not allowed to make explosives, even if I do have all the
    supplies.
29. I am not allowed to render any member of my party to obtain those
    supplies.
30. I am not the default love interest and should stay away from any
    non-dwarf royalty we encounter.
31. I am not the evil twin, but only because I don't have a twin.
32. I am not the Grey Poupon distributor for the kingdom, and I cannot
    ladle it onto the illusionist and offer him to dragons as a free
    sample.
33. I am not the Grey Poupon distributor for the kingdom, and I should
    stop giving dragons a discount on the stuff.
34. I am not the rightful heir to the Burger King, I'm just telling a
    whopper.
35. I cannot improve my defenses by writing "-10 Armor Class" on my
    shirt.
36. I don't get to keep chaotic monsters that followed me home unless I
    intend to skin them.
37. I don't know what I was thinking when I said the longbowman was "out
    of ammo" after six shots.
38. I don't want you to turn this adventure around.
39. I should stop screaming about "the power of grayskull" and take
    cover from the crossbows.
40. I should stop writing "Bite Me" in orcish on my party leader's
    shield.
41. Must stop writing ANYTHING in orcish on party members" shields.
42. "I was bored" is not an excuse for anything done with a loaded
    ballista.
43. I was not placed in charge of the prisoners so that I could
    slaughter them and "the paladin wouldn't get his hands dirty."
44. I was not seduced by the Demon Queen of Pormax, and the scars from
    that adventure are not "love tattoos."
45. If I sing "I'm A Lumberjack and I'm Okay" just one more time,
    they're gonna make me eat my axe.
46. If it looked like a duck, quacked like a duck, and tasted like a
    duck, but had a collar indicating it's sacred to a local goddess, we
    should skip dessert and start running.
47. In joining a group of adventurers, the party leader does actually
    become the boss of me, and I should respond accordingly in combat.
48. In my case, "innocent until proven guilty" is an offense against the
    gods.
49. In my case, an aphorism indicating "that's when you find out who
    your friends really are" is just noise in the wind.
50. Inquisitors have no sense of humor. They also don't like this fact
    pointed out to them.
51. It is wrong to greet Inquisitors by shouting "stick to the story!"
    to other party members.
52. It is not motivational to talk about adventure parties that died in
    situations "just like this."

    we're hired to protect the tax collector.
61. It would not have worked if it weren't for those meddling kids.
62. It's a Monarchy based on Oral Law. There is no Free Speech.
63. It's never too early to tell the others where I packed the healing
    potions.
64. Labels on the vials of potions are not the sign of a weak mind,
    they're really a good idea.
65. Labels on the vials of potions should be popular names in a common
    tongue, not pictionary graphics.
66. Evidently I cannot draw a clear "healer" to save my life.
67. It's not important who's right and who's wrong as long as the party
    leader is right.
68. Jousting is the sport of knights on horseback, not dwarves on dining
    tables.

    castle.

    things.

    class fighter/thief.
72. Leave the animation of the dead to professionals.

    axles, and drive it to the king's castle as a gift "from concerned
    friends."
82. Ditto the alchemist, half ton breathmint, the queen, "loving but
    scandalized subjects."

    back to his temple and commend him to the bishop for the sexual

    fears."
199. When carrying the wounded half-orc back to camp, I should not cut
    him in two to save the human half first.

201. When Death lets us challenge him in order to stay alive, we will
    pick a board game, not Whack-A-Toad.

    don't know where the heart is on an elf, I should not whip out a
    grease pencil and provide visual aids.

    until proven to be literal, not the other way around.

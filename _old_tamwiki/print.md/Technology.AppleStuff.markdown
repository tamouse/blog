iPod Stuff
----------

-   Rather cool little accessory for an iPod Photo that turns it into a
    personal video player. [Story

Tools
-----

-   *Sound Recording:* There's no native sound recorder in OS X it seems
    (at least, I couldn't find one). So I hunted up a tool to do just
    that:
    [AudioX](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/index.php/weblog/comments/3/)
    from [RealMac Software](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/). Cost is
    \$19.95. I'll update this when I see how it works.
    -   Even better is freeware, open-source:
        [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/), a sound recorder,
        editor, very high powered tool.
    -   Can also use GarageBand to record audio.

-   Desktop Manager: <http://desktopmanager.berlios.de/index.php> -
    "Desktop Manager is my own pet project to implement a (hopefully)
    easy to use virtual desktop manager for OS X. I've put it up here in
    the hope that it will be useful to others. Simply run the app and a
    pager should appear in the status bar and on the desktop."

Issues and Resolutions
----------------------

-   Had a problem with my powerbook G4's power brick. It had started
    having problems delivering a charge to the battery and current to
    the system. The little blinky LEDs on the attachment were flickering
    between yellow and red. Turns out this is a known problem with the
    power brick. I bought a new one (\$80) and it did the trick. I
    wonder how long apple will support the powerbook G4 and have that
    power brick available. With luck, they won't redesign it and
    obsolete the current one. If that happens, I'll try to snatch up 2
    or 3 of them. I guess that's a potential problem with a second-hand
    product. (But I \<3 it so!)
    -   This is no longer an issue with the release of the MagSafe power
        connector on the new macbooks. A great solution!

Variations
----------

For additional flavour, cook in chicken or beef broth. *Note:* avoid
bouillon as it is far too salty.

Comments
--------

You can cook wild rice in the oven instead of the stove top; it can be
put directly into casseroles that will bake for a long time, provided
there is enough moisture in the casserole.

You can also cook wild rice in the microwave, although I've never tried
this. It still takes about half an hour in the microwave, so not
altogether clear there is that much convenience in it vs. the stovetop.

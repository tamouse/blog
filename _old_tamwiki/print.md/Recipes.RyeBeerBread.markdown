-   1 1/2 cups room temperature beer
-   2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
-   2 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
-----------

1.  Combine rye flour, beer, and yeast in a large bowl. Cover bowl with
    plastic wrap. Set out overnight. Do not refrigerate.
2.  The next day, add sugar, salt, shortening, and egg; beat with mixer
    until smooth. Stir in caraway seeds, if wanted. Add enough white
    bread flour to make a soft dough.
3.  Knead on a lightly floured surface until smooth, approximately 10
    minutes. Place in a greased bowl, and turn to oil the surface of the
    dough. Let rise in warm place about 1 hour, or until doubled.
4.  Punch down dough, and divide in half. Shape into round or oblong
    loaves, and place on greased baking sheets sprinkled with corn meal.
    Let rise for 30 minutes.
5.  Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Cool on racks.

Lessons from the Geese
----------------------

Geese migrate every Fall and Spring. Their migration is an awesome
sight. Geese have developed a strong interdependence that enables them
to make the long journey. Here are some lessons from the geese.

<div class="vspace">

</div>

Fact
:   As each bird flaps its wings, it creates an "up lift" for the bird
    following. By flying in "V"-formation, the whole flock adds 71%
    greater flying range than if each bird flew alone.

Lesson
:   People who share a common direction and sense of community can get
    where they are going quicker and easier because they are traveling
    on the thrust of one another.

Fact
:   Whenever a goose falls out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag
    and resistance of trying to fly alone. It quickly gets back into
    formation to take advantage of the lifting power of the bird
    immediately in front of it.

Lesson
:   If we have as much sense as a goose, we will stay in formation with
    those who are heeded where we want to go.

Fact
:   When the lead goose gets tired, it rotates back into the formation
    and another goose flies at the point position.

Lesson
:   It pays to take turns doing the hard tasks and sharing the
    leadership. People, as with geese, are interdependent on one
    another.

Fact
:   The geese in formation honk from behind to encourage those up front
    to keep up their speed.

Lesson
:   We need to maker sure our "honking" from behind is encouraging, not
    something less helpful.

    </div>

Fact
:   When a goose gets sick or wounded or shot down, two geese drop out
    of formation to follow it down and protect it. They stay with the
    downed goose until it is either able to fly again or dies. Then they
    launch out on their own with another formation or catch up with
    their flock.

Lesson
:   If we have as much sense as geese, we will stand by one another.

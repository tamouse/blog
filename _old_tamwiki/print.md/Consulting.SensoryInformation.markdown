<span id="excerpt"></span> Information that relies on sensory data, such
as sight, hearing, smell, feeling (internal and external) and taste. In
some cases, intuition can be added here as well. <span

Of these, in the West, Visual (sight) is the most common sensory mode

, make sure to find out what their

Here are the names of the sensory inputs from <span class="wikiword">[NeuroLinguisticProgramming](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Consulting.NeuroLinguisticProgramming?action=print)</span>:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Visual (sight)
2.  Auditory (hearing)
    -   analog: pitch, tone, timbre, etc
    -   digital: words, phrases, etc

3.  Kinesthetic (feeling)
    -   internalized (emotions, feelings)
    -   externalized (movement, touch, presence)

4.  Oliphactory (smell)
5.  Gustatory (taste)

situations, but smell can be an interesting one in exploring some
client's <span

Product \#CMR096. Creativity in all fields, including business,
flourishes under intrinsic motivation--the drive to do something because
it is interesting, involving, exciting, satisfying, or personally
challenging. This article presents the Componential Theory of
Organizational Creativity and Innovation, which defines the factors-
including intrinsic motivation- that determine a person's creativity.
This article also shows how the work environment can influence
individual creativity.

Subjects: Creativity; Human Behavior; Innovation; Motivation

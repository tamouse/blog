Ingredients
-----------

-   ~~3~~
    2
    eggs
-   1.5 cups finely grated pecorino romano cheese (plus more for
    serving)
-   2 tablespoons olive oil
-   6 ounces diced guanciale or pancetta
-   salt, to taste (the romano cheese and the guanciale/pancetta are
    pretty salty already)
-   6 ounces dried spaghetti
-   freshly ground black pepper, to taste

<div class="vspace">

</div>

Directions
----------

1.  in a bowl, whisk together eggs and romano cheese
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

2.  Heat oil in a skillet to medium, fry up the guanciale or pancetta
    until browned and fat has rendered. *(Here, the W-S recipe does not
    call for draining the fat from the meat, just setting it aside
    instead. I'd suggest getting rid of at least some of the fat.)*

    </div>

3.  bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil, add the
    pasta and cook until *al dent??*. Drain, reserving about 1 cup of
    the cooking water.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

4.  slowly whisk 1/2 cup of pasta water into egg-cheese mixture.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

5.  return skillet to medium heat and rewarm. Add the pasta and 1/4 cup
    reserved pasta water; toss to combine. Remove pan from heat. Pour in
    egg mixture; toss well to combine.

    </div>

6.  Season generously with ground black pepper.

    </div>

7.  Serve at once, do not let the eggs cook too much (like not at all!)

Comments
--------

Spaghetti or vermicelli are long, thin pasta. Sometimes it's easier to
deal with them if you break them into thirds before cooking them.

I think useful additions to the spicing would be basil and possibly even
a touch of peppermint, although way not traditional.

### First time - [tamara](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Profiles.Tamara?action=print) October 03, 2011, at 07:19 PM

-   1/2 cup parmesan instead of romano
-   maple flavoured bacon instead of pancetta
-   1 medium onion
-   1 teaspoon minced garlic
-   1 teaspoon dried basil
-   1 teaspoon dried oregano
-   3 ounces frozen corn kernels
-   1 can sliced mushrooms

<div class="vspace">

</div>

1.  whisk the eggs, parmesan and spices together.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

2.  sautee the chopped onions, garlic and mushrooms until the onions
    have turned translucent. Set aside.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

3.  cut up the bacon and fry until done. Drain on paper towels.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

4.  boil the pasta and corn together.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

5.  pour 1/3 cup hot pasta water into egg-cheese-spice mixture before
    combining.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

6.  omit the water from the final combining step.

#### Notes:

-   This would probably have been a better without the maple flavoured
    bacon and onions -- the final dish was more sweet than savoury.
-   It definitely needed more cheese.
-   I think the eggs need to set more, so tossing everything together on
    the heat and letting the eggs cook more would be beneficial. 3 eggs
    is also way too much for the amount of pasta used. Another recipe
    called for 2 eggs to a pound of pasta; since here I only used 6
    ounces of pasta, 2 eggs would definitely be better than 3.

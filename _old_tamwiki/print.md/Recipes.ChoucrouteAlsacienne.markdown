Variations
----------

This time I didn't have any carroway seeds, so instead I used sage,
thyme and paprika as seasoning. If I'd had any rosemary, I'd have used
that as well.

Jaques P??pin has a fantastic [Choucroute
Garnie](http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/choucroute-garnie) recipe
that involves using pork ribs, kielbasa sausage, skinless hot dogs and
baked ham in the dish.

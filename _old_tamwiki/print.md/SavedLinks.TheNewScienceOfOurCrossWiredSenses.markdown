The senses have always been our portals into the outer world. We have
the classic five that Aristotle talked about — sight, hearing, smell,
taste, and touch — plus more recently recognized senses of balance,
temperature, pain, and body position and movement. Each evolved to
collect some distinct type of information about our environment, and to
tell us our status within it.

That's largely how we tend to think about the senses, anyway:
separately, each one its own distinct way to understand the world around
us.

But in recent years, various findings have emerged to challenge that
assumption — strange illusions in which one sense seemed to change the
perceptions of another. One study published in 2000 particularly grabbed
people's attention: When researchers at Caltech showed test subjects a
brief flash of light accompanied by two quick tones, many people saw two
flashes instead of one. The same effect occurred when the researchers
tapped their subjects' skin twice as the light flashed. Vision —
considered our most reliable and dominant sense — could be altered by
sound or touch.

And that wasn't all. Other studies showed that what people saw affected
what they heard; that certain types of music or background noise
affected how food tasted; and that smells could influence how a texture
felt to the touch.

I've been making pancakes for years and years, since I was a pre-teen.

I don't know if this really calls for a recipe or not, as I pretty much
just follow the directions for making pancakes on the back of the
Bisquik box and toss in a huge pile of blueberries.

Ingredients
-----------

-   3 cups bisquik pancake mix
-   2++ cups milk (this is a lot more than is called for on the box. I
    like my batter a lot runnier.)
-   2 eggs
-   1 half pint of fresh blueberries ~~*(I think this can be done with
    frozen blueberries, but I've never tried it.)*~~ This works well
    with frozen blueberries -- I did it without even thawing them out
    ahead of time.

Directions
----------

1.  Mix the first three ingredients into a batter. Adjust the amount of
    milk to make it the consistency you like. I add a lot more than the
    box recipe.

2.  Fold in the blueberries, getting them well distributed

3.  Heat a skillet until a drop of water skitters around the surface but
    doesn't evaporate

4.  Pour pancakes in 1/2 cup amounts into the pan. Don't put too many
    down at once, keep things where you can easily turn them and handle
    them

5.  Wait until the top surface bubbles form and break, but don't
    disappear, then flip the pancake over and cook the other side

Serve with maple syrup and bacon for a scumptuous feast!

Variations
----------

I think you can do this with pretty much any addition:

-   chocolate chips
-   cut up strawberries
-   cut up raspberries or blackberries (or, if in California:
    olalaberries!)
-   cut up bananas
-   chopped pecans
-   chopped walnuts

Buckwheat blueberry pancakes are **extra** special. Just use buckwheat
pancake mix instead of bisquick.

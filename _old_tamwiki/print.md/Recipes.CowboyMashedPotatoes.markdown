Variations
----------

Since some members of my family cannot deal with peppers, I have to omit
the jalapeño. If I were making it with peppers, I'd probably use
habañero instead of jalapeño since I'm none too keen on the flavour.
Alternatively, this would probably taste completely awesome with
chipotlé instead of jalapeños.

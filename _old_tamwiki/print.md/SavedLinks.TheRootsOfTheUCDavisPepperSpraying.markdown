This is the most important effect of the Occupy movement: acts of
defiance, courage and conscience are contagious. Just as the Arab Spring
clearly played some significant role in spawning, sustaining and growing
the American Occupy movement, so too have the Occupy protesters
emboldened one another and their fellow citizens. The protest movement
is driving the proliferation of new forms of activism, citizen passion
and courage, and — most important of all — a sense of possibility.

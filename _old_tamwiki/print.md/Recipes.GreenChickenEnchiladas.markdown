Directions
----------

### For salsa:

1.  Preheat broiler. Rinse the tomatillos under warm water to remove any
    stickiness and dirt. Place the tomatillos, onion and jalape??o on a
    baking sheet lined with foil and broil 3 to 4 inches from heat,
    turning once, until tomatillos are softened and slightly charred,
    about 7 to 10 minutes.

3.  Transfer the tomatillos, onions and jalape??o to a blender with the
    cilantro, cumin, sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pur??e until
    smooth.

4.  Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and add
    the salsa and cook over until thickened, about 5 minutes, stirring
    frequently to prevent sticking. (If you plan to freeze the salsa,
    cool it at this point and freeze it. To use it, defrost and continue
    with recipe.)

5.  Add the broth and cook for another 5 minutes. The salsa should be
    slightly thickened and not watery at all. Remove from heat and whisk
    in the sour cream.

### For the enchiladas:

1.  Brush both sides of the tortillas lightly with the remaining 1
    tablespoon oil and lay on a cookie sheet in stacks of two. Heat just
    until soft and pliable, about 3 minutes.

2.  In a large bowl, combine chicken, 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese, 3/4 cup
    Monterey Jack cheese, onion and salt. Add 1/2 cup of the sauce to
    the chicken mixture and toss to combine.

3.  Spread 1/3 of sauce in the bottom of a 9- by 13-inch baking dish.
    Place about 1/4 cup of filling in center of 1 tortilla. Roll up
    tortilla. Place seam side down in baking dish. Repeat with remaining
    tortillas. Pour remaining sauce over enchiladas. Sprinkle with
    remaining cheese. Bake until cheese melts and enchiladas are heated
    through, about 20 minutes.

Comments
--------

-   If you want to make extra tomatillo salsa to freeze, double the
    amount of the first seven ingredients. Follow the directions in the
    recipe up to the point of adding the broth. Freeze half of the salsa
    for up to 2 months, and use the other half with this dish.

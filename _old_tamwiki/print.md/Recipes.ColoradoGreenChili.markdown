Like it's cousin, <span
class="wikiword">[ColoradoRedChili](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Recipes.ColoradoRedChili?action=print)</span>,
this recipe came from a friend of mine out in Colorado who goes by the
handle Fielding Melish. This is a green variety of chili, a chili verde.
Note that the "Colorado" in the title doesn't mean the Spanish word for
"red" -- it's where the recipe originated.

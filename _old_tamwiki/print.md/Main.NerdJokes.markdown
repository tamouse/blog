Geeks

Two IT guys were biking across the park.

one said, ??Where did you get such a great bike???\
The second IT guy replied, ??Well, I was walking along yesterday minding
my own business when a beautiful woman rode up on this bike. She threw
the bike to the ground, took off all her clothes and said, 'Take what
you want.'"\
The first IT guy nodded approvingly, ??Good choice, The clothes probably
wouldn??t have fit.??

Physics
-------

Have you heard that entropy isn't what it used to be?

One day Heisenberg and Schroedinger went for a drive and got stopped by
a traffic cop.

The cop asks Heisenberg, who's driving, "Sir, do you know how fast you
were going?"\
Heisenberg replied, "No, but I know where I am."\
The cop, thinking such a weird response deserves futher investigation,
tells Heisenberg to open the trunk.\
The cop looks in and says, "Do you know there's a dead cat in here?"\
Schroedinger replies, "Well, I do now!"

There was an old lady called Wright

who could travel much faster than light.\
She departed one day\
in a relative way\
and returned on the previous night.

On October 20, 2012, we hosted the monthly potluck of the “Church of the
Circle Supper”. We had one of our good friends, Sandy, bring along her
keyboard and harp to entertain us. It was my parents' 60th wedding
anniversary, my birthday, Ed's birthday, and various other celebrations.
A fun time was had by all!

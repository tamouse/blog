David Imus worked alone on his map seven days a week for two full years.
Nearly 6,000 hours in total. It would be prohibitively expensive just to
outsource that much work. But Imus' 35-year veteran of cartography who's
designed every kind of map for every kind of client - did it all by
himself. He used a computer (not a pencil and paper), but absolutely
nothing was left to computer-assisted happenstance. Imus spent eons
tweaking label positions. Slaving over font types, kerning, letter
thicknesses. Scrutinizing levels of blackness. It's the kind of personal
cartographic touch you might only find these days on the
hand-illustrated ski-trail maps available at posh mountain resorts.

A few of his more significant design decisions: Your standard wall map
will often paint the U.S. states different colors so their shapes are
easily grasped. But Imus' map uses thick lines to indicate state borders
and reserves the color for more important purposes - green for denser
forestation, yellow for population centers. Instead of hypsometric
tinting (darker colors for lower elevations, lighter colors for higher
altitudes), Imus uses relief shading for a more natural portrait of U.S.
terrain.

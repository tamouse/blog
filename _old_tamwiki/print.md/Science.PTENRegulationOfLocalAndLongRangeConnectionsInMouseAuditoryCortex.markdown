Abstract
--------

Autism spectrum disorders (<span class="wikiword">ASDs</span>) are
highly heritable developmental disorders caused by a heterogeneous
collection of genetic lesions. Here we use a mouse model to study the
effect on cortical connectivity of disrupting the ASD candidate gene
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10). Through
Cre-mediated recombination, we conditionally knocked out PTEN expression
in a subset of auditory cortical neurons. Analysis of long-range
connectivity using channelrhodopsin-2 revealed that the strength of
synaptic inputs from both the contralateral auditory cortex and from the
thalamus onto PTEN-cko neurons was enhanced compared with nearby neurons
with normal PTEN expression. Laser-scanning photostimulation showed that
local inputs onto PTEN-cko neurons in the auditory cortex were similarly
enhanced. The hyperconnectivity caused by PTEN-cko could be blocked by
rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of the PTEN downstream molecule
mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1. Together, our results suggest
that local and long-range hyperconnectivity may constitute a
physiological basis for the effects of mutations in PTEN and possibly
other ASD candidate genes.

We are in a new world where opening up to questions is more important
than closing in on an answer (getting the right answer to the wrong
problem can be worse than having no answer to the right question).

List of 100 Questions
---------------------

In his exciting book, 'How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci,' Michael
Gelb encourages people to make a list of 100 questions. (Try it ... it
is not as easy as it may sound.) He offers us ten great questions drawn
from different people's lists:

<div class="vspace">

</div>

-   When am I most naturally myself? What people, places, and activities
    allow me to feel most fully myself?
-   What is one thing I could stop doing, or start doing, or do
    differently, starting today that would most improve the quality of
    my life?
-   What is my greatest talent?
-   How can I get paid for doing what I love?
-   Who are my most inspiring role models?
-   How can I best be of service to others?
-   What is my heart's deepest desire?
-   How am I perceived by: my closest friend, my worst enemy, my boss,
    my children, my co-workers, etc.?
-   What are the blessings of my life?
-   What legacy would I like to leave?

Search for Questions Rather Than Answers

(www.newdirections.uk.com) reports on a conference focused on 'Processes
for the New Millennium' that urged looking for questions rather than
answers and for Best Problems rather than Best Practices.

Thanks to everyone who submitted questions â€” we hope they stimulate your
thinking for this new year in a new millennium!

Questions submitted by readers --
---------------------------------

One question could be a meta-question:

-   What assumptions are inherent in my questions?\
    \
    (In other words, What paradigm is dictating the questions I ask? In

essence, if I ask how to organize my time better, there is an inherent
assumption in the question that time is limited, life is hectic, and we
need to consciously organize to 'save' what little there is. Another
paradigm may contain being with time as abundant, and relevance--which
dictates action--emerging as a natural self-organizing system that we
allow to inform us instead of control, organize, or even balance. Of
course, this would come with challenging the nature of all current
accepted belief systems (including our beliefs about the nature of the
Universe and life), and therefore the nature of everything we do and
think...and, ironically, that can be time 'consuming' in the current
**time-as-lack** paradigm architecture from which our general society
lives and works).

I think Dee Hock, founder, Chaordic Alliance, has posed the most
important questions for the millennium:

-   Why are institutions, everywhere, increasingly unable to manage
    their affairs?
-   Why are individuals, everywhere, increasingly in conflict with and
    alienated from the institutions of which they are part?
-   Why are society and the biosphere increasingly in disarray?

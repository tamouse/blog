<span id="excerpt"></span> The times I've visited Australia have been
magical, in no small part because of the way they make some food their
own. The hamburger, a traditional American fry-out food, is transformed
into something glorious here. What really makes it aussie is "put an egg
onnit". <span id="excerptend"></span>

Getting pop-up notifications on various platforms
-------------------------------------------------

At the suggestion of the remind author, I set up remind to use something
that can be defined separately for each platform, but called the same in
the remind file.

David's suggestion was to write a script that could be called for each
platform:

<div id="sourceblock1" class="sourceblock">

<div class="sourceblocktext">

<div class="email">

This solution would probably work, but I was a bit reluctant to put
something in a global directory *(I don't know **why** exactly -- I'm
the only user on both systems.)* so instead I used an
[envar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) to give the
shell command to execute for the popup.

NOTIFY Enironment Variable
--------------------------

NOTIFY is an [environment
variable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) that
contains a string for a shell command to execute to pop up the reminder.

On Ubuntu, the NOTIFY command that works best is:

         NOTIFY='/usr/bin/notify-send -t 0 REMINDER'

On Mac, the NOTIFY command should be:

         NOTIFY='/usr/local/bin/growlnotify --sticky --message'

For this to work the entire message must be quoted

On non-Ubuntu linuxen or other unixen with X Windows, you can probably
gin something up with xmessage:

         NOTIFY='/usr/bin/xmessage -center'

Best place to set this is in your `$HOME/.profile`.

<div class="vspace">

</div>

<div class="round lrindent important2">

DON'T FORGET TO EXPORT NOTIFY.

</div>

To use this feature, run remind in server-mode:

<div class="vspace">

</div>

      remind -z <remind-files> &

(Include the & to send it to the background.)

<div class="vspace">

</div>

Creating events that use the pop-up
-----------------------------------

The way the RUN directive works, however, means you effectively have to
put the event in twice:

1.  so it shows up in the regular run of remind -q (no events)
2.  so it can be used to run a pop-up notification using the \$NOTIFY
    envar

In your .rem file, create an event as follows:

<div class="vspace">

</div>

<div id="sourceblock2" class="codeblock">

<div class="codeblocktext">

    REM <datespec> MSG '<reminder text>'
    REM <datespec> AT <timespec> RUN $NOTIFY '<reminder text>'

</div>

<div class="codeblocklink">

[raw
code](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Technology.RemindGettingPopupsOnDifferentPlatforms?action=sourceblock&num=2)

</div>

</div>

For example:

<div id="sourceblock3" class="codeblock">

<div class="codeblocktext">

    REM 8 Sep 2012 MSG Doctor Appointment at 2:30pm
    REM 8 Sep 2012 AT 14:30 +1 RUN $NOTIFY 'Doctor Appointment at 2:20pm'

</div>

<div class="codeblocklink">

[raw
code](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Technology.RemindGettingPopupsOnDifferentPlatforms?action=sourceblock&num=3)

</div>

</div>

<div class="vspace">

</div>

<div class="round lrindent important2">

Keep the reminder text quoted so that it ends up being one shell
parameter when the \$NOTIFY command is called. This is due to the way
growlnotify works on os/x.

Summary:Different platforms have different programs to display a pop-up
message, Growl on the Mac, D-Sub on Ubuntu, others on other nixen. This
describes a technique to make the remind files agnostic, yet giving the
capability to the user to handle this Parent:(Technology.)Remind <span

Please don't EVER remove this story. I am also disabled and my cyber
stalker has begun publishing cartoons mocking my disability and that I
suffer from incontinence.

He and a young man he mentors have threatened to kill me with a .50
caliber hollow point bullet to the brain.

This person even claims that he is the originator of "Don't kick a Tiger
in the ass if you don't have a plan for the teeth."

Be careful, he might be here soon, and claim to have you arrested if you
keep this posted.

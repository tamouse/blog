There are literally hundreds of tutorials and howtos to be found on the
web that purport to walk the budding sysadmin through configuring a web
server in the best way possible. Many of these extol the benefits of
running PHP through CGI under suEXEC or adding suPHP to the mix so PHP
scripts run with the same permissions as the script owner. These lists
of instructions wind on for pages and pages with little to no
explanation as to what the procedure is doing to your precious server
and are very often out-of-date or tailored for a different operating
system than they claim. The purpose of this guide is to provide a
concise, clear, and up-to-date tutorial on installing Apache 2.2 and
<span class="wikiword">FastCGI</span>-based PHP 5 under suEXEC on a
modern Debian installation. It assumes some pre-existing familiarity
with \*nix-based systems and Apache virtual hosts.

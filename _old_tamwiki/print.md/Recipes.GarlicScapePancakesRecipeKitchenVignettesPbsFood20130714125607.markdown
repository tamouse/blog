This is the time of year when garlic plants work their magic. They shoot
out their scapes: long curly tips that need to be picked off so that the
plant invests all of its energy into its bulb, ensuring nice fat heads
of garlic to be harvested later in the summer. In the meantime, while we
wait for our garlic bulbs to reach full size, we can enjoy elegant
scapes. They??re gorgeous to look at, and delicious to eat!

Scapes are kind of like a bonus gift when you grow your own garlic. I
like to spend hours in the garden photographing them. (Someone usually
has to come pry me away). They are so intricate and full of character.
In fact, I am so crazy about scapes that they were the subject of [my
first ever blogpost and cooking
video](http://kitchenvignettes.blogspot.ca/2011/08/ok-ive-been-wanting-to-start-this-blog.html)
two years ago.

Though pesto is what I most often make out of garlic scapes, there are
many other ways to cook them. You can steam like green beans or saut??e
them with other veggies. A little while back I decided to sneak them
into one of my favourite recipes: Chinese scallion pancakes. If you??ve
never had the pleasure of biting into a scallion pancake, you??ve got to
make these! They??re chewy and flaky and dunked into a ginger soy
dipping sauce, totally addictive.

If your curiosity is piqued, you??ll want to watch this video. It??s one
of my all-time favourite cooking videos, produced by the classy folks
over at Saveur Magazine, and featuring the one and only Martin Yan
preparing classic scallion pancakes.

I hope Mr. Yan will forgive me for using garlic scapes instead of the
traditional scallions! But I tried this out and it worked beautifully.

The thing that makes these pancakes so special is that the dough is
layered, or ??laminated??.

Laminated pastry refers to dough that is alternately layered with fat.
Examples are croissants, puff pastry, and danish dough. The more layers
there are, the flakier the pastry will be. In this case, lamination is
achieved by rolling out the dough, brushing it with sesame oil (and
chopped garlic scapes), then rolling it into a ??cigar??.

The ??cigar?? is then coiled in on itself into a ??snail.??

The ??snail?? is then squashed down with the palm of your hand, rolled
out, and fried up in a skillet.

I use spelt flour in my version because I find white flour can be a
little gluey at times and I love the nutty flavour of whole spelt. Plus
using whole grain gives these a little more nutritional value. I
experimented with making three different versions: one using all white
flour, one using all spelt, and one using part white and part spelt
flours. The latter was my favourite in both texture and flavour. But you
can choose the version you??d like to make, the flour amounts are the
same either way. Serve these pancakes hot off the skillet, with dipping
sauce. They make a great appetizer on their own, or a lovely
accompaniment to soups, curries, or stir fries. Enjoy!

Ingredients
-----------

### Pancakes:

-   1 cup whole spelt flour (optional, use white flour if you prefer)
-   1 1/2 cup unbleached white flour
-   1/2 cup boiling water
-   1/2 cup cold water
-   1/2 tbsp. baking powder
-   1 tsp. sea salt
-   1/4 cup toasted sesame seed oil
-   2 cups finely chopped garlic scapes

<div class="vspace">

</div>

### Dipping Sauce:

-   3 tbsp. organic soy or tamari sauce
-   3 tbsp. rice vinegar
-   1 to 2 tsp. freshly grated ginger
-   1 tsp. sesame oil
-   1 tsp. sugar or honey
-   A pinch of dried chili flakes (optional)

<div class="vspace">

</div>

### For frying:

-   About 1/4 cup grapeseed or peanut oil

<div class="vspace">

</div>

Directions
----------

1.  Mix the spelt and white flours together with the salt. Put half of
    the mixture in one bowl and half in another bowl.
2.  In one bowl add 1/2 cup boiling water. Mix with a wooden spoon until
    the dough can handled. Knead for 2 minutes in the bowl.
3.  In the other bowl, mix the baking powder into the flour. Add the
    cold water and mix with a wooden spoon until dough can be handled.
    Knead for 2 minutes in the bowl.
4.  Incorporate both doughs together by kneading them into one another
    for 5 minutes on a lightly floured surface. This dough is very
    forgiving. If its too dry, simply add a bit of water. If it's too
    sticky, simply add a bit of flour. The dough should feel nice and
    moist but not stick to your hands.
5.  Shape into a ball, and place in a bowl with a damp towel on top and
    let it rest at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours.
6.  Cut the dough into 4 pieces.
7.  Roll each one into a thin 9 or 10 inch circle.
8.  Brush with one tablespoon of sesame oil and sprinkle with about 1/2
    cup of garlic scapes, evenly distributed over the surface.
9.  Roll the dough into a tight cylinder and pinch in the edges to seal.
    Coil this cylinder into a spiral and tuck in the end. Flatten it
    into a disc with the palm of your hand. Roll this out into a flat
    pancake, about 1/4 inch thick. Repeat with the remaining pieces of
    dough. Let the 4 pancakes rest for about 10 minutes before frying.
10. Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce by whisking all ingredients
    together.
11. Heat about 1 tablespoon of oil in a heavy skillet on medium heat.
    When the oil is hot, gently place the pancake into the pan and cook
    on each side for about 2 to 3 minutes or until nice and golden.
    Repeat with remaining pancakes. Cut the pancakes into wedges and
    serve hot, with the dipping sauce.

Tips/Techniques
---------------

If you wish to keep your pancakes warm, place them on a baking sheet in
a 200 F oven. However, they are best when served straight off the
skillet.

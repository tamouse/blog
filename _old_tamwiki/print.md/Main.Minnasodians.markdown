MINNASODIANS (aka Minnesnodians)
================================

Just in case ya didn't know...
------------------------------

-   Minnesota became the 32nd state on May 11, 1858 and was originally
    settled by lost tribes of Swedes & Norwegians seeking refuge from
    the searing heat of Wisconsin 's winters.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

-   Minnesota gets it's name from the Sioux Indian word
    "mah-nee-soo-tah," meaning, "No, really...!!!! They eat fish soaked
    in lye."
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

-   The state song of Minnesota is "Someday the Vikings will... Aw,
    never mind."
    <div class="vspace">

    square feet and has enough space to hold 185,000 idiot teenagers
    yapping away on cell phones.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

-   Madison, Minnesota is known as "the lutefisk capital of the world."
    Avoid this city at all costs.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

-   "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" was set in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and
    was Mary's first real acting job since leaving the "Dick van Dyke
    Show." The show, about a single woman's struggle to find happiness
    in the big city was originally titled "Life Without Dick," but that
    was changed for some reason.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

-   Downtown Minneapolis has an enclosed skyway system covering 52
    blocks, allowing people to live, work, eat, and sleep without ever

    nougat -chocolate, Spam and lutefisk.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

-   Tonka trucks continue to be manufactured in Minnetonka, Minnesota,
    despite the thousands of GI Joe dolls killed by them annually in
    rollover accidents. No airbags, no seat belts. These things are
    deathtraps, I tell ya!
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

-   Author Laura Ingalls Wilder was raised in Walnut Grove, Minnesota,
    and was famous for writing the "Little House" series of books, as
    well as inventing the "Spam diet" which consists of looking at a
    plate of Spam until you lose your appetite. Much like the "lutefisk
    diet"
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

-   The snowmobile was invented in Roseau, Minnesota so as to allow
    families a means of attending 4th of July picnics.
    <div class="vspace">

-   Minnesotans are almost indistinguishable from Wisconsinites. The
    only way to tell them apart is to ask if they voted for Mondale in
    '84.

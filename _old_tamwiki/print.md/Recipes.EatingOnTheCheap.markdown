Starving student, starving artist, starving person with no income? Here
are some things to make eating still enjoyable.
Even if you can't afford the stuff on
[StockIngredients](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Recipes.StockIngredients?action=print),
there are some things that you should try to keep around to make meal
times more interesting.

<span id="toc1"></span>Foods to keep around
-------------------------------------------

-   Sri-racha. A Vietnamese chile sauce that makes practically
    everything taste better. It doesn't need to be refrigerated.
-   Soy sauce. Also essential for giving good flavour to things. Also
    needs no refrigeration.
-   Peanut butter. A good, cheap source of protein.
-   Ramen. The little celo packets cost about ten to twenty cents a
    piece and offer a variety of flavours. Also, these can be prepared
    in many ways other than just making soup.
-   Apples. A good fruit, source of many vitamins, keep a long time
    without refrigeration.
-   Kraft Dinner. The only caveats about this are it requiring milk
    and/or butter. But you can make it with just the flavour packet and
    water if you need to.
-   If refrigeration isn't a problem, cheap bulk hot dogs in large packs
    make it [easy to get some
    protein](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Recipes.DirtCheapDinner?action=print).
    (I apologize to any vegetarians out there.)
-   Parmesan cheese. The green cans are good enough. If you use it up
    fast enough, it doesn't need refrigeration. (When I was a kid, this
    stuff never went in the fridge. Must be modern times.)

<span id="toc2"></span>Essential equipment
------------------------------------------

-   1 plate, 1 bowl, 1 fork, 1 spoon, 1 knife, 1 glass, 1 cup. That's
    it. Just have to wash them constantly, but you don't need a whole
    pile of dishes weighing you down.
-   2 quart pot with lid. Essential for cooking ramen, boiling hot dogs,
    etc.
-   a large spoon for handling whatever is in the pot.

<span id="toc3"></span>False economies
--------------------------------------

-   Hamburger Helper. This stuff contains hardly anything except a
    little bit of macaroni and dried sauce. If you want macaroni, just
    buy a big bag of it. It's cheap and keeps forever. Sauce is just
    cream of mushroom soup, also cheap in cans and keeps forever. If you
    want more flavour, add sri-racha and parmesan cheese to it, the
    green cans are good enough.

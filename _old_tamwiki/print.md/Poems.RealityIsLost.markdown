Reality is lost
---------------

In the beginning of the end\
A needle mainline's the drug\
Soaring high above the earth\
Can't get enough of the rush\
Reality is lost

Eyes staring, people whispering\
Is it all in my mind\
Paranoia has taken over\
My once clear thoughts shattered\
By confusion

Fear and anger\
Try to destroy these powerful delusions\
So I can be free again\
But the voices in my head won't stop

No control of the demons paralysing\
My mind\
One way to end it\
Disturbing thoughts plotting my death\
A way out is found

Twisting faces, laughing, teasing\
The demons have won\
Too late to fight it\
Need to be free

I take a knife\
Plunging, twisting, turning\
Blood is shed\
I am free

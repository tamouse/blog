The Most Astounding Fact [<span class="wikiword">[NdGTyson](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Main.NdGTyson?action=edit)[?](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Main.NdGTyson?action=edit)</span>]

</div>

### What is the most astounding fact you can share with us about the Universe?

The most astounding fact is the knowledge that the atoms that comprise
life on Earth, the atoms that make up the human body, are traceable to
the crucibles that cooked light elements into heavy elements in their
core under extreme temperatures and pressures. These stars, the high
mass ones among them went unstable in their later years. They collapsed
and then exploded scattering their enriched guts across the galaxy; guts
made of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and all the fundamental ingredients of
life itself. These ingredients become part of gas clouds that condense,
collapse, form the next generation of solar systems stars with orbiting
planets, and those planets now have the ingredients for life itself.

So that when I look up at the night sky and I know that yes, we are part
of this universe, we are in this universe, but perhaps more important
than both of those facts is that **the Universe is in us**. When I
reflect on that fact, I look up – many people feel small because they’re
small and the Universe is big – but I feel big, because my atoms came
from those stars. There’s a level of connectivity. That’s really what
you want in life, you want to feel connected, you want to feel relevant;
you want to feel like a participant in the goings on of activities and
events around you.

And that’s precisely what we are, just by being alive.

Nothing "mere" about science [Feynman]
--------------------------------------

<span id="feynman01"></span> Poets say science takes away from the
beauty of the stars— mere globs of gas atoms. Nothing is ‘mere’. I too
can see the stars on a desert night, and feel them. But do I see less or
more? The vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination— stuck on
this carousel my little eye can catch one-million-year-old light. A vast
pattern— of which I am a part… What is the pattern or the meaning or the
why? It does not do harm to the mystery to know a little more about it.
For far more marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past
imagined it. Why do the poets of the present not speak of it? What men
are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were a man, but if he is an
immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent.

Pale Blue Dot [Sagan]

<div class="round lrindent quote">

![](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=uploads.Main.Quotes.palebluedot.jpg)

</div>

“Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it
everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every
human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our
joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and
economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward,
every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant,
every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child,
inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt
politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and
sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust
suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the
endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel
on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how
frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one
another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled
by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they
could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have
some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point
of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping
cosmic dark. **In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint
that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.**

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is
nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could
migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the
Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building
experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of
human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. **To me, it
underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and
to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever
known.**”

The purpose of power [Orwell, 1984]
-----------------------------------

<div class="round lrindent quote">

“Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party
seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good
of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure
power means you will understand presently. We are different from the
oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the
others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites.
The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in
their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own
motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had
seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around
the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and
equal. We are not like that. We know what no one ever seizes power with
the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end.
One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a
revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the
dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of
torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now you begin to
understand me.”

I warn you [Neil Kinock]

If Margaret Thatcher is re-elected as prime minister on Thursday, I warn

I warn you that you will have pain–when healing and relief depend upon
payment.\
I warn you that you will have ignorance–when talents are untended and
wits are wasted, when learning is a privilege and not a right.\
I warn you that you will have poverty–when pensions slip and benefits
are whittled away by a government that won’t pay in an economy that
can’t pay.\
I warn you that you will be cold–when fuel charges are used as a tax
system that the rich don’t notice and the poor can’t afford.\
I warn you that you must not expect work–when many cannot spend, more
will not be able to earn. When they don’t earn, they don’t spend. When
they don’t spend, work dies.\
I warn you not to go into the streets alone after dark or into the
streets in large crowds of protest in the light.\
I warn you that you will be quiet–when the curfew of fear and the gibbet
of unemployment make you obedient.\
I warn you that you will have defence of a sort–with a risk and at a
price that passes all understanding.\
I warn you that you will be home-bound–when fares and transport bills
kill leisure and lock you up.\
I warn you that you will borrow less–when credit, loans, mortgages and
easy payments are refused to people on your melting income.\
If Margaret Thatcher wins on Thursday–\
– I warn you not to be ordinary\
– I warn you not to be young\
– I warn you not to fall ill\
– I warn you not to get old.

Never leave that until tomorrow which you can do today [Grey → Franklin]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

“A couple hundred years ago Benjamin Franklin shared with the world the
secret of his success. Never leave that 'til tomorrow, which you can do
today. This is the man who discovered electricity; you'd think we'd pay
more attention to what he had to say. I don't know why we put things
off, but if I had to guess it has a lot to do with fear. Fear of
failure, fear of pain, fear of rejection. Sometimes the fear if just of
making a decision. Because... What if you're wrong? What if you make a
mistake you can't undo? Whatever it is we're afraid of, one thing holds
true: That by the time the pain of not doing the thing gets worse than
the fear of doing it, it can feel like we're carrying around a giant
tumor. And you thought I was speaking metaphorically... 'The early bird
catches the worm.' 'A stitch in time saves nine.' 'He who hesitates is
lost.' We can't pretend we haven't been told. We've all heard the
proverbs, heard the philosophers, heard our grandparents warning us
about wasted time; heard the damn poets urging us to seize the day.
Still, sometimes we have to see for ourselves. We have to make our own
mistakes. We have to learn our own lessons. We have to sweep today's
possibility under tomorrow's rug until we can't anymore. Until we
finally understand for ourselves what Benjamin Franklin meant. That
knowing is better than wondering. That waking is better than sleeping.
And that even the biggest failure, even the worst most intractable
mistake, beats the hell out of not trying.”

Part of the whole [Einstein]
----------------------------

<span id="einstein01"></span> A human being is a part of the whole,
called by us "Universe", a part limited in time and space. He
experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated
from the rest ?? a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This
delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal
desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us.

Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our
circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of
nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the
striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and
a foundation for inner security.

manages to get people to let them do it to them.\
To summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who must want to
rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it.\
To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves
made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.

Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers,
the round pegs in square holes. The ones who see things differently.
They're not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status-quo.
You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the
only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things. They
push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy
ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think they
can change the world, are the ones who do.

commits oneself, then Providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to
help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of
events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of
unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man
could have dreamed would have come his way. **Whatever you can do, or
dream you can do, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it.
Begin it now.**"

<span id="warner01"></span> I am convinced that *attitude* is the key to
success or failure in almost any of life's endeavors. Your attitude --
your perspective, your outlook, how you feel about yourself, how you
feel about other people -- determines your priorities, your actions,
your values. Your attitude determines how you interact with other people
and how you interact with yourself.

Endurance - Foregiveness [Niebuhr]
----------------------------------

Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime; therefore
we must be saved by hope. Nothing which is true or beautiful or good
makes complete sense in any immediate context of history; therefore we
must be saved by faith. Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be
accomplished alone; therefore we are saved by love. No virtuous act is
quite as virtuous from the standpoint of our friends or foes as it is
from our standpoint. Therefore we must be saved by the final form of
love which is forgiveness.

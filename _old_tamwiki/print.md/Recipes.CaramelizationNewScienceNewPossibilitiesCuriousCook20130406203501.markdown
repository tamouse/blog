### Caramelization: new science, new possibilities

[http://www.curiouscook.com/.a/6a0133f5708090970b016305bdf06a970d-320wi](http://www.curiouscook.com/.a/6a0133f5708090970b016305bdf06a970d-pi)

For me, the epitome of stovetop alchemy is  making caramel from table
sugar. You start with refined sucrose, pure crystalline sweetness, put
it in a pan by itself, and turn on the heat. When the sugar rises above
320°F/160°C, the solid crystals begin to melt together into a colorless
syrup. Then another 10 or 20 degrees above that, the syrup begins to
turn brown, emits a rich, mouth-watering aroma, and adds tart and savory
and bitter to its original sweetness.

That's the magic of cooking front and center: from one odorless,
colorless, simply sweet molecule, heat creates hundreds of different
molecules, some aromatic and some tasty and some colored.

How does heat turn sugar into caramel? Heat is a kind of energy that
makes atoms and molecules move faster. In room-temperature table sugar,
the sucrose molecules  are jittery but standing in place, held still by
the forces of attraction to their neighbors. As the sugar heats up in
the pan, its molecules get more and more jittery, to the point that
their jitters overcome the attractive forces and they can jump from one
set of neighbors to another. The solid crystals thus become a
free-flowing liquid. Then, as the temperature of the sugar molecules
continues to rise, the force of their jittering and  jumping becomes
stronger than the forces holding their own atoms together. The molecules
break apart into fragments, and the fragments slam into each other hard
enough to form new molecules.

That's what I've thought for many years, along with most cooks and
confectioners and carbohydrate chemists: heat melts sugar, and then
begins to break it apart and create the delicious mixture we call
caramel.

And we've all been wrong.

It turns out that, strictly speaking, sugar doesn't actually melt.  And
it can caramelize while it's still solid. So proved chemist Shelly
Schmidt and her colleagues at the University of Illinois in studies
published last year.

It's dismaying to think that so many could be so wrong for so long about
such a basic ingredient and process! But it's also a rare opportunity to
rethink the possibilities of the basic. Here's a plateful of
possibilities; scroll down for more.

[http://www.curiouscook.com/.a/6a0133f5708090970b0168ebb3661d970c-500wi](http://www.curiouscook.com/.a/6a0133f5708090970b0168ebb3661d970c-pi)

Professor Schmidt's group made their discovery when they tried to nail
down the precise melting point of sucrose. The figures reported in the
technical literature vary widely, and it wasn't clear why.

The melting point of a substance is the temperature at which it turns
from a solid into a liquid while maintaining its chemical identity. When
solid ice turns into liquid water, for example, the molecules of H~2~O
move fast enough to escape the attractive forces of their neighbors, but
they're still H~2~O. And it doesn't matter how fast the substance heats
up: the melting point is the same. Ice melts at 32°F/0°C. Always.

After careful analysis, Professor Schmidt found that whenever sugar gets
hot enough to turn from a solid into a liquid, some of its molecules are
also breaking apart. So sucrose doesn't have a true melting point.
Instead it has a range of temperatures in which its molecules are
energetic enough to shake loose from their neighbors, and a range in
which the molecules jitter themselves apart and form new ones. And these
two ranges overlap. Whenever sugar gets hot enough to liquefy, it's also
breaking down and turning into caramel. But it starts to break down even
before it starts to liquefy. And the more that sugar breaks down while
it's still solid, the lower the temperature at which it will liquefy.

When we make caramel standing at the stove, we use high heat to liquefy
and then brown the sugar in a few minutes, and the liquefying
temperature can be upwards of 380°F/190°C. But Professor Schmidt's group
found that when they ramped up the heat slowly, over the course of an
hour, so that significant chemical breakdown takes place before the
solid structure gives way, the sugar liquefied at 290°F/145°C.

I made the caramelized sugars in these photos by putting crystals and
cubes in my gas oven at around 250°F/125°C, shielding them with foil
above and below to avoid temperature extremes from the cycling heating
element, and leaving them there overnight and longer. In the large sugar
crystals, which I got in a Chinese market, it's clear that breakdown and
caramelization is fastest in the center. That may be because the center
is where impurities get concentrated as the crystals are made, and the
impurities then kickstart the breakdown process.

[http://www.curiouscook.com/.a/6a0133f5708090970b016305f72f92970d-500wi](http://www.curiouscook.com/.a/6a0133f5708090970b016305f72f92970d-pi)

Caramel makers have long known that, as is true in most kinds of
cooking, the key to caramelization is the combination of cooking
temperature and cooking time. But the the temperatures have typically
been very high, the times measured in minutes. Now we know that you can
caramelize low and very slow and get something different. Sugar
breakdown even occurs at ambient storage temperatures, though it takes
months for the discoloration and flavor change to become noticeable. For
a manufacturer this is undesirable deterioration. But for a cook in
search of interesting ingredients, it could be desirable aging.

In a follow-up to her initial scientific reports, Professor Schmidt
wrote in *Manufacturing Confectioner* that

<div class="vspace">

<div class="indent">

from a practical point of view, caramelization can be thought of as
browning of sucrose by applying heat for a length of time. Thus it may
be possible to better control the caramelization reaction by identifying
the time-temperature conditions that optimize the production of
desirable caramel flavors compounds, while minimizing undesirable ones.
Confectionery manufacturers and sugar artisans, armed with this new
scientific knowledge, may be able to push their craft in unforeseeable
directions.

For example: aged sugar, roasted sugar, caramel-center crystals. Let the
pushing begin!

*This raises what (to me, at any rate) are interesting (and related)
issues:*

*Style in on-line writing: how it differs from traditional writing
conventions for the printed page. How do things one can only do-line
(like hyperlinks or text which changes as a result of a mouse rollover,
for example) affect the author's turn of phrase, choice of words, or
focus?*

AND

*The standardization (or current lack thereof) of Internet (and here
I've really put the cart before the horse: does one capitalize Internet
when writing about the greater Internet as an entity? I do, and it seems
that most writers do as well) terminology both in material written for
on-line and print publication.*

*Are there any official 'standards' beyond some loosely accepted
conventions (like the aforementioned capitalization issue, and the use
of a dash in e-mail), and who decides what they are?*

*Anybody want to comment? I'm particularly interested in any on-line
guides to 'Internet Style' or definitive lists of proper 'usage' and
orthography of Internet and on-line terminology that OWLers may have
found.*

Here's a 'Jump Page' from my forthcoming Write for the Web, which
includes URLs for Jutta Degener's super pages--she doesn't like 'check
out' and says 'Internet' deserves a capital I, if only to distinguish
the global Net from local networks of networks (internets).

Here are some pages that offer good advice about writing for the Web.
Such pages usually offer still more links to additional resources. You

Directions
----------

1.  Heat the bottom of a frittata pan over medium heat until hot. Add
    oil. When oil is hot enough to sizzle a piece of potato, spread
    potatoes in pan. Cook potatoes, turning occasionally with a wide
    spatula, until they are evenly browned and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes.
    Add onion and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Sprinkle potatoes with
    salt and paprika.

2.  Meanwhile, bring medium saucepan half full of water to a boil. Add
    broccoli and cook, uncovered, for 3 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold
    water and shake dry. Add broccoli ~~and peppers~~ to frittata pan,
    distributing them evenly on top of potatoes.

3.  In small bowl, whisk the eggs, 2 tablespoons water and a grinding of
    black pepper until frothy. Pour eggs over vegetables. Sprinkle
    cheese on top.

4.  Cook over medium to medium-low heat, tilting pan to allow uncooked
    eggs in the center to run under the set eggs around the edges, for 5
    minutes.

5.  Heat the top of the frittata pan and spray with cooking oil. When
    hot, put on top of bottom frittata pan and invert on burner. Cook
    until eggs are evenly set, 3 to 5 minutes more. Cut into wedges and
    serve directly from the pan.

Water actually isn't white, and it's a really hard lesson to learn as an
artist (I'm still working on it). What it is is reflective and
transparent. The White of your photograph \*is\* white, but only because
the light inside the water had bounced back inside itself a lot, so what
you are seeing is actually reflected pure light. As you can see next to
your white, often what you are seeing is the color of wet rock (When you
aren't getting back reflected Sky. That would be the blue in the water).

In anycase, there are a lot of approaches to handle this situation.
Masquing the white reflections, and coloring the rest as if you were
painting a rock scape, then going over with a very weak greying wash
(Payne's Gray or Ultramarine work here) would be the way I would go
about it if I didn't want to cheat.

However, as an artist, I would cheat and switch media and use Watercolor
Pencils to get the details right. If I really cared about an accurate
representation.

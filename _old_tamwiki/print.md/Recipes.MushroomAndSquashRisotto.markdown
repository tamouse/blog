2.  Make the mushroom broth: Remove the shiitake stems and transfer to a
    separate saucepan. Add 5 cups water, the bay leaf, ½ cinnamon stick,
    peppercorns and %frac12; teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, cook 3
    minutes, then remove from heat and set aside to infuse, 30 minutes.
    Strain into the saucepan with the porcini soaking liquid, squeezing
    the liquid from the shiitake stems; discard the solids.

3.  Meanwhile, chop the shiitake mushroom caps and mixed mushrooms. Heat
    3 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil in an extra-large
    skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, red pepper flakes and
    the remaining ½ cinnamon stick and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add the
    shiitake caps and the mixed mushrooms in an even layer and cook,
    undisturbed, until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir and continue
    cooking until the mushrooms are soft, about 3 more minutes. Season
    with salt and discard the cinnamon stick.

4.  Bring the mushroom broth to a simmer. Heat 2 tablespoons butter and
    the 1 remaining tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.
    Add the squash, onion, porcinis, and ½ teaspoon salt; cook,
    stirring, for 5 minutes. Add the rice and toast, stirring
    constantly, for 2 minutes. Add the wine and simmer, stirring, until
    absorbed, about 1 minute. Add 3 cups hot broth, return to simmer and
    cook, stirring, until most of the liquid is absorbed, 8 to 10 more
    minutes. Add 3 more cups broth and mushroom mixture; bring to a
    simmer and cook, stirring, until rice is *al dente*, 10 to 15
    minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon
    butter, the grated cheese and parsley.

Sauces and Dressings. Simple to hard. Nowadays, you can get mixes for
all kinds of sauces. But sometimes it's nice to make them from scratch.

Other Sauces
------------

I prefer to buy the following sauces rather than to try to make them:
<span id="handysauces"></span>

-   Soy sauce
-   Hoisin sauce
-   Sri-Racha or Thai Chili Garlic Sauce
-   Teriyaki sauce
-   Ketchup
-   Tikki Masala sauce
-   Mustard
    -   Mustard is one of those things that has developed into quite a
        speciality line. You can get mustard in all sorts of flavours:
        honey, spicy, coarse ground, chipotle, raspberry, ... I could go
        on, but they'll invent more. This is something to investigate.
-   Mayonnaise (or something like Miracle Whip).
-   Barbecue sauce. This is a very personal thing -- everyone has their
    own favourite. Mine is Rudoph's, from the restaurant here in
    Minneapolis. They also make a dynamite cole slaw dressing.
-   Salad dressing -- here, dressings can be used as ingredients in
    certain dishes, as well as coverings for your greens. Things go
    waaaaaaaaay beyond ranch or thousand island.
    -   Oriental Ginger dressing -- I've seen several of these,
        sometimes with citrus, sometimes without.
    -   Raspberry vinegrette -- does so many things!
    -   *Note:* if you want Thousand Island, you can make it quite
        easily: equal parts ketchup, mayonnaise and pickle relish.
    -   Nothing much beats topping a salad with lemon juice or balsamic
        and a bit of olive oil. Bottled dressings tend to contain less
        useful fats and often high-fructose corn syrup.

<span id="excerpt"></span> Making your own stock is a great way to use
leftover things like poultry carcases, meat bones, etc. <span
id="excerptend"></span>

This is for a meat-based stock. For vegetarian stock, see <span
class="wikiword">[MakingVegetableStock](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Recipes.MakingVegetableStock?action=print)</span>.

<span id="ingredients"></span>

Ingredients
-----------

-   8 to 12 cups water
-   3 to 4 peeled and diced carrots
-   2 to 3 cleaned and diced celery stalks -- you can include the tops
    here as well
-   2 medium onions, peeled and diced
-   whatever herbs you might like to add -- marjoram, thyme, rosemary,
    sage, etc
-   salt and pepper to taste -- I tend to go very light on the salt, or
    omit it entirely, depending on the meat being used
-   some leftover meat products. Examples include:
    -   Turkey carcass leftover from roasting a bird (we typically have
        this at Thanksgiving and/or Christmas)
    -   Carcass from a store-bought rotissery chicken
    -   Smoked Ham hocks (not recommending you use these for ingredients
        in other dishes, necessarily. They have a lot of fat and grisle,
        and not that much actual meat)
    -   Smoked turkey legs (these come two to a package in our local
        grocery store)

</div>

1.  Bring to a boil on the stove top. Cover and turn down to a simmer,
    for 2 hours or so.

\

<div class="vspace">

</div>

1.  Let the stock cool, placing into a fairly cold area (the
    refrigerator works great, but I use our porch during the winter as
    it gets equally cold!).

</div>

1.  Skim the congealed fat off after the stock has cooled, also removing
    whatever bones, grisle, fat and things you don't want.

1.  Strain the stock into a large bowl.

</div>

1.  Use the stock straight away, or freeze it for future use.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

2.  You can reserve the strained contents for other uses, such as in
    [soup](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Recipes.SplitPeaSoupWithHam?action=print).

Stock freezes really well. Some great suggestions are to freeze it in
ice cube trays so you have small amounts needed for some recipes, or to
freeze it in single recipe units for larger uses.

The last time I made stock, I used smoked ham hocks. This made some
great stock, but then I tried to use the hocks in [split pea
soup](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Recipes.SplitPeaSoupWithHam?action=print)
and it didn't turn out so well.

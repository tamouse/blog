While [Andy Beck](http://www.andybeck.co.uk/) may be better known for
his portrait and figurative work, it??s his paintings of city streets
which really catch my attention. Originally from Coventry, Beck moved to
London almost ten years ago and it??s clear that the city has played an
important role in inspiring his work.

Looking at his paintings you can almost feel the weather in them. You
can sense the cold, crisp air of a winter??s morning or you can see how
the sun shines right after the rain. His paintings show a great
understanding for how these moments feel in a city and he paints them
with such beauty. You can view a complete gallery of Beck??s landscape
painting on his website

<span id="fn1_1"></span>^1^ The heat of the griddle/pan will depend on
how long you grill for -- don't set the heat too high as it is much more
likely to end up with charred bread and solid insides. Lower heat is
more easily managed. [⇑](#fnr1_1)

<span id="fn1_2"></span>^2^ If you have a sandwich/panini grill, or one
of those George Foreman Grills, they can make doing grilled cheese
really easy, grilling both sided of the sandwich at the same time, and
smooshing it a bit to give some extra tooth. [⇑](#fnr1_2)

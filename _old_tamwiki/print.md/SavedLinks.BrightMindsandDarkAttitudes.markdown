Abstract
--------

Despite their important implications for interpersonal behaviors and
relations, cognitive abilities have been largely ignored as explanations
of prejudice. We proposed and tested mediation models in which lower
cognitive ability predicts greater prejudice, an effect mediated through
the endorsement of right-wing ideologies (social conservatism,
right-wing authoritarianism) and low levels of contact with out-groups.
In an analysis of two large-scale, nationally representative United
Kingdom data sets (N = 15,874), we found that lower general intelligence
(g) in childhood predicts greater racism in adulthood, and this effect
was largely mediated via conservative ideology. A secondary analysis of
a U.S. data set confirmed a predictive effect of poor abstract-reasoning
skills on antihomosexual prejudice, a relation partially mediated by
both authoritarianism and low levels of intergroup contact. All analyses
controlled for education and socioeconomic status. Our results suggest
that cognitive abilities play a critical, albeit underappreciated, role
in prejudice. Consequently, we recommend a heightened focus on cognitive
ability in research on prejudice and a better integration of cognitive
ability into prejudice models.

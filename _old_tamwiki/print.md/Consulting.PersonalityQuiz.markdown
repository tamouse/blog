Interpretation of score
-----------------------

Over 60 Points
:   Others see you as someone they should "handle with care". You're
    seen as vain, self-centered, and extremely dominant. Others may
    admire you, wishing they could be more like you, but don't always
    trust you, hesitating to become too deeply involved with you.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

51 To 60 Points
:   Others see you as an exciting, highly volatile, rather impulsive
    personality; a natural leader, who's quick to make decisions, though
    not always the right ones. They see you as bold and adventuresome,
    someone who will try anything once; someone who takes chances and
    enjoys an adventure. They enjoy being in your company because of the
    excitement you radiate.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

41 To 50 Points
:   Others see you as fresh, lively, charming, amusing, practical, and
    always interesting; someone who's constantly in the center of
    attention, but sufficiently well-balanced not to let it go to their
    head. They also see you as kind, considerate, and understanding;
    someone who'll always cheer them up and help them out.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

31 To 40 Points
:   Others see you as sensible, cautious, careful & practical. They see
    you as clever, gifted, or talented, but modest... Not a person who
    makes friends too quickly or easily, but someone who's extremely
    loyal to friends you do make and who expect the same loyalty in
    return. Those who really get to know you realize it takes a lot to
    shake your trust in your friends, but equally that it takes you a
    long time to get over it if that trust is ever broken.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

21 To 30 Points
:   Your friends see you as painstaking and fussy. They see you as very
    cautious, extremely careful, a slow and steady plodder. It'd really
    surprise them if you ever did something impulsively or on the spur
    of the moment, expecting you to examine everything carefully from
    every angle and then, usually decide against it. They think this
    reaction is caused partly by your careful nature.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

Under 21 Points
:   People think you are shy, nervous, and indecisive, someone who needs
    looking after, who always wants someone else to make the decisions &
    who doesn't want to get involved with anyone or anything. They see
    you as a worrier who always sees problems that don't exist. Some
    people think you're boring. Only those who know you well know that
    you aren't.

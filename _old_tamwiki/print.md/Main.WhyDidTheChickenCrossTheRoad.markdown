Arthur Andersen Consultant
:   Deregulation of the chicken's side of the road was threatening its
    dominant market position. The chicken was faced with significant
    challenges to create and develop the competencies required for the
    newly competitive market. Andersen Consulting, in a partnering
    relationship with the client, helped the chicken by rethinking its
    physical distribution strategy and implementation processes. Using
    the Poultry Integration Model (PIM), Andersen helped the chicken use
    its skills, methodologies, knowledge, capital and experiences to
    align the chicken's people, processes and technology in support of
    its overall strategy within a Program Management framework. Andersen
    Consulting convened a diverse cross-spectrum of road analysts and
    best chickens along with Anderson consultants with deep skills in
    the transportation industry to engage in a two-day itinerary of
    meetings in order to leverage their personal knowledge capital, both
    tacit and explicit, and to enable them to synergize with an
    enterprise-wide value framework across the continuum of poultry
    cross-median processes. The meeting was held in a park-like setting,
    enabling and creating an impactful environment which was
    strategically based, industry-focused, and built upon a consistent,
    clear, and unified market message and aligned with the chicken's
    mission, vision, and core values. This was conducive towards the
    creation of a total business integration solution. Andersen
    Consulting helped the chicken change to become more successful.

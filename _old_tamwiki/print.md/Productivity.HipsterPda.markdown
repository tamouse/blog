What is the [Hipster PDA](http://www.hipsterpda.com/)?
------------------------------------------------------

The [Hipster PDA](http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/Hipster_PDA) is a
low-tech, unglamourous way to organize data you want to keep with and
have handy. All it is, is a stack of index cards held together by a
binder clip. Easily stashed in a back pocket (i.e. "at your hip" hence
the name "Hipster"), purse, briefcase, etc.

Why is this interesting when I have a ~~Treo PDA~~ ~~iPhone 3GS~~ Droid
3? Because low-tech solutions appeal to me as much as high-tech
solutions do. I like certain aspects of pen and paper and dislike
certain aspects of ~~thumbboard~~ ~~virtual keyboard~~ slider and
screen.

-   Paper and pen have better resolution.
-   Faster to hand write something than to type it in (although this is
    less true with the Droid 3 slider).
-   Can easily hand to someone as a take-away.

There are other aspects of electronic PDA that I find much more
attractive than paper and pen, which pulled me away from the daytimer
approach to the palm approach and on to smartphones.

-   Don't have to transfer items between calendar pages (i.e., annual to
    monthly to daily; repeating appointments)
-   Faster to look up contact info

~~On the Treo, the two applications I use the most are the calendar and
the contact list. I find the to do list application cumbersome and
difficult to use to capture and manage actions / tasks.~~

~~On the iPhone, I use the calendar feature a lot, as well as the
contact feature. I don't much like most of the Task management apps out
there. What I really enjoy using is

With the Droid 3, which runs Android 2.x, I am linked very nicely to my
Google Calendar, Contacts, Mail, Docs, and all the other Google apps I
use. I find this system tremendously more powerful than the iPhone. A
lot of the applicaitons I like to work with are already on Android,
including the inimical

So I might organize my life around
[GTD](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Productivity.GettingThingsDone?action=print)
as a paper solution to hold Next Actions, Projects, and Contexts, with
the electronic calendar to hold the "Hard Landscape" of my days, and
other applications to hold more permanent items of note. I'm currently
using
[todocli](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Productivity.Todocli?action=edit)[?](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Productivity.Todocli?action=edit)
to manage all my next actions, projects, etc. It's working pretty
well. --

I must admit, I saw this on a youtube video, but I can't remember which

Ingredients
-----------

-   1 package ramen noodles (such as top ramen)
-   2 hot dogs (the cheap, bulk variety)
-   ketchup and mustard packets stolen from fast food places
-   sri-racha (if you don't have any sri-racha (well, you should get
    some!) .. err.. ahem, if you don't have any sri-racha, you can
    substitute with hot sauce packets stolen from taco bell)

Shallots, garlic, wine, tomatoes, and cream make a fabulous fresh sauce
for prawns (or shrimp) and pasta. It is paired with angel hair pasta
here, but feel free to use your favorite pasta or even cheese
tortellini. Have all your ingredients chopped and ready to go because
this dish only takes about 15 minutes to cook from start to finish.

Variations
----------

As mentioned above, you can use sun-dried tomatoes in this instead of
fresh Roma tomatoes. Don't use any other kind of tomatoes unless you
grow them yourself or get them from someone who does. Supermarket
tomatoes (even the organics) are grown to be shipped and have virtually
no flavour.

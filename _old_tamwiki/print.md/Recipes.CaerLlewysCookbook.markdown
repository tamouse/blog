Caer Llewys (Lion's Den) is the home name of my friends Cymru and Alaric
and their three kids (as well as a sprinkling of hangers-on and such).
They're serious geeks, and serious gourmets. Their cookbook is a
collection of the things they've tried (and it's HUGE) and found
successful. The cookbook lives at:
<http://www.caerllewys.net/public/recipes.pdf> and is GPLed.

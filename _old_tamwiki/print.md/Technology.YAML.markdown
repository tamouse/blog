<span id="excerpt"></span> YAML is one of my favourite ways of setting
up data and configurations for projects. My current
[resume](http://tamouse.org/about/resume-page/) is in YAML. <span

YAML is one of those recursive acronyms "YAML Ain't Markup Language"
that litter the free software world. It lets you build up information
that takes the form of scalars, lists (arrays) and hashes (associative
arrays). YAML has support for nearly all modern and past languages.

Using YAML is pretty straight-forward with the one caveat:

<div class="vspace">

</div>

<div class="round lrindent warning2">

<span style="font-size:120%">**YAML does not deal with tabs in
input!**</span>\
All indentation must be spaces!\

-   The [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) on Wikipedia is a
    very good introduction to YAML.
-   There is a nice little [cheat sheet](http://yaml.org/refcard.html)
    on the [yaml site](http://yaml.org).
-   YAML integrates well with many languages and tools, as evidenced by
    the project list on the [YAML home page](http://yaml.org).

YAML is a *great* way to store application configuration data, load and
dump data from a data base for transfer elsewhere, and
serialize-unserialize information to pass between programs. It isn't
nearly as universally accepted as XML and JSON, but it's particular
amenable to such usage due to it's inherent readability by both humans
and machines.

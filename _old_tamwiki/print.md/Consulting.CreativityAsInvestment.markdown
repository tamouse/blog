This article describes an investment theory of creativity. It suggests
that a creative person needs to defy the crowd to buy low and sell high
in the realm of ideas, just as a successful financial investor defies
the crowd and buys stocks when they are out of favor and sells them when
they become popular. Creative ideas are often unpopular. To overcome the
resistance to those ideas, creative people--as well as companies
desiring to encourage c reativity--need to invest in six resources:
knowledge; intellectual abilities; thinking styles; motivation;
personality; and environment. All of these resources need to be present
for a creative enterprise to succeed.

Subjects: Creativity; Human Resources Management; Innovation;
Organizational Behavior

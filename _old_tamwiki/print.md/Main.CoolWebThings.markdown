The Pocket Kit, fitting inside an altoids tin, is easy to keep on hand
at all times. This is ideal for anyone who wants to have the essential
survival gear along each time they head into the field. Everything fits
in the Altoids tin (above). It fulfills all the component groups (see
??Make Your Own,?? last slide) except for shelter and protection, but
add a survival blanket to your pocket and you??ll be covered. Keep
clicking through the following slides for details on all of this kit's
components.

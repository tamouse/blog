This World Is Not Conclusion
----------------------------

*by Emily Dickinson*

this world is not conclusion\
a species stands beyond -\
invisible, as music -\
but positive as sound -

it beckons, and it baffles\
philosophy - don't know -\
and through a riddle, at the last -\
sagacity must go -

to guess it, puzzles scholars -\
to gain it, men have borne\
contempt of generations\
and crucifixion, shown -

faith slips - and laughs, and rallies -\
blushes, if any see -\
plucks at a twig of evidence -\
and asks a vane, the way -

much gesture, from the pulpit -\
strong hallelujahs roll -\
narcotics cannot still the tooth\
that nibbles at the soul -

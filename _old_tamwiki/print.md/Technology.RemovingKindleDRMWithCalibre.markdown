**Calibre Plugins: The simplest option for removing DRM**

<div class="vspace">

</div>

1.  You must already be able read your ebooks, either on your computer
    or on your ebook reader. (Kindle, nook, etc.) If you cannot read
    your ebooks on your computer or on your ebook reader, you won t be
    able to remove the DRM. Contact your ebook retailer and sort out any
    problems reading your ebooks before trying to remove the DRM.
2.  Download and install the latest [calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/)
    for your Operating System.
3.  Download the latest [combined tools
    package](http://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/2010/02/11/hello-world/),
    and unzip it. (On Windows, right-click and Extract All ; After
    extracting all, rename the tools\_vX.X.zip to backup\_tools.zip to
    prevent later confusion)
4.  Run calibre. Click Preferences. Do **NOT** click Get plugins to
    enhance calibre , that option is reserved for official calibre
    plugins. Instead select Change calibre behavior Then under Advanced
    click on Plugins. (looks like a puzzle piece)
5.  Click on the large Load plugin from File button
6.  Navigate to the tools folder unzipped in step 2
7.  Open the Calibre\_Plugins folder
8.  Select one of the zip files in that folder
9.  Click on Add (or the button may say Open )
10. Click on the Yes button in the warning dialog that appears. A
    Confirmation dialog appears that the plug-in has been installed.
11. Repeat steps 4 to 9 for every zip file in the Calibre\_Plugins
    folder (five at present).
12. You must now configure the plugins. Which plugins need configuring,
    and the information you need to enter depends on what kind of ebooks
    you have. If your ebooks don t match the description at the start of
    any of the following items, ignore it and move on to the next.\
    \
    To configure a plugin, you must find it in the list of plugins. All
    the DRM removal plugins are in the File Type plugins section of the
    Plugins section of the calibre prefereces. Click on the plugin in
    the list to select it, and then click on the Customize plugin
    button. In the dialog that then pops up, enter the required
    information, detailed below.

    1.  If you have Mobipocket ebooks, where you either entered a PID on
        the retailer s web site, or you must read them in Mobipocket
        Reader, you must enter the PID you entered on the retailer s web
        site, or the PID of your installation of Mobipocket Reader into
        the customisation field of the <span
        class="wikiword">K4MobiDeDRM</span> plugin. The PID will be ten
        numbers and letters, with \* or \$ as the eighth character. If
        you have more than one PID, enter them separated by commas,
    2.  If you have Amazon Kindle ebooks that were downloaded to your
        Kindle, you must enter your Kindle s serial number into the
        customisation field of the <span
        class="wikiword">K4MobiDeDRM</span> plugin. If you have already
        entered a PID there, add the Kindle serial number as well,
        separating it from the PID with a comma. Please note: all <span
        class="wikiword">PIDs</span> and Kindle Serial Numbers are
        **case-sensitive**.
    3.  If you have Amazon Kindle ebooks that were downloaded to the
        copy of Kindle for Mac or Kindle for PC that was installed on
        this computer, you do not need to add anything extra into the
        customisation fields.
    4.  If you have ePub ebooks that can be read in Adobe Digital
        Editions, you do not need to add anything extra into the
        customisation fields.
    5.  If you have PDF ebooks that can be read in Adobe Digital
        Editions, you do not need to add anything extra into the
        customisation fields.
    6.  If you have ePub ebooks from Barnes and Noble (e.g. for nook),
        you must enter your name (NOT YOUR E\_MAIL ADDRESS) and full
        credit card number into the customisation field of the Ignoble
        Epub <span class="wikiword">DeDRM</span> plugin. The name and
        credit card number should be the ones set as part of the Credit
        Card unlock code on your Nook Library page. Separate the name
        from the number with a comma **and do not put any spaces in the
        card number or around the comma.**
    7.  If you have eReader ebooks from Barnes and Noble, or from, say,
        Fictionwise, your must enter your name and the last 8 digits of
        your credit card number into the customisation field of the
        eReader PDB 2 PML plugin. Again, the name and credit card number
        must be the ones entered at your ebook retailer s website as the
        DRM key/Unlock code.
    8.  If you have ebooks bought at the Apple iBooks store, you need to
        find and use Requiem 3.3 or later by Brahms. It is NOT part of
        the tools package.
    9.  If you have Microsoft LIT ebooks, there is no Calibre plugin
        that can remove the DRM.

13. Now click on the Apply button, and then close the preferences.

You are now ready to remove the DRM from your ebooks. Just import them
into calibre, and the DRM will be removed. The plugins ONLY remove the
DRM when the ebooks are imported. If you have already imported your
ebooks into calibre, your will need to remove them and import them
again.

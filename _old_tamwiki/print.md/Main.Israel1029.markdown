Notes for 10/29/96, Tuesday. Our last day in Israel.

Free day today. Most people are going shopping. I'm not sure yet what
I'm going to do. I would like to go see the scrolls; I also would like
to have someone along with me.

Celebration Dinner

Lashana haba birushalayim: Next year in Jerusalem

Gifts given:

-   to John: a bowl, very pretty, that he fell in love with in Safed.
    Julie bought one just like it for Chuck.
-   to Carol: microcaligraphy of the book of ruth, very pretty, and
    different from most of themicrocalligraphy we saw.
-   to Gilla: a widow's mite (ancient Hebrew coin) set in a gold pendant
    of evil eye warding hand
-   all of us: Certificates of Attestation as Jerusalem Pilgrims.

Very touching, ar feeings all around, Gilla was deeply moved by our
gift, clearly not a very usual thing for her. She definitely appreciated
us s a group, and Carol most especially.

2.  In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef, onion,
    garlic, and marjoram. Drain the beef, and mix in the zucchini. Cook
    and stir until vegetables are tender. Mix in the salsa, tomato soup,
    and corn. Season with 1 teaspoon salt. Transfer to the prepared
    baking dish.

3.  In a medium bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, sugar, cream of
    tartar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and garlic powder. Cut in the butter
    until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the Cheddar
    cheese, sour cream, and milk. Spread over the beef mixture in the
    baking dish.

4.  Bake covered in the preheated oven 25 minutes, or until the topping
    is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out
    clean.

Variations
----------

I think I might try other things in this as well: carrots, squash, lima
beans, peas, maybe even eggplant. Just using margoram seems a bit thin
on spices to me as well. I'd probably also add ground black pepper, a
bit of chili powder, maybe some cumen. Also, instead of soup, I think
tomato paste, milk, and some more spices would work wonders.

This site is my personal wiki, implemented in <span
class="wikiword">[PmWiki](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=PmWiki.PmWiki?action=print)</span>.
Here I keep all kinds of things, from Books I want to read, Movies I
want to see, and Music I want to listen to, to Food and Lifestyle and
Health concerns, to Management and Consulting topics, to Computers,
Software Development, and Internet things, as well as various
collections of things I've accumulated over the years.

I apologize for the unfinished nature of this wiki. I have been slowly
porting over entries from a previous wiki system and it is boring and
time consuming. So bear with me!

A Wiki is like a normal web site, except that you can edit the content
in your browser

-   "Wiki" is short for "wiki wiki", the Hawaiian for "Quick"
-   The idea originates from [Macintosh
    Hypercard](http://www.hyperdictionary.com/computing/hypercard), via
    [Ward Cunningham](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham)
-   In Ward's words, Wiki is *"the simplest online database that could
    possibly work"*
-   A Wiki is basically a shared, online, persistant whiteboard
-   Anyone can add content or change what is written or change the
    *organisation* of the content
-   Whatever you write is nicely presented, remembered, and never
    forgotten

"What will *that* get for you?"
-------------------------------

<span id="excerpt"></span> This question establishes motive and intent.
It is useful to ask this because the reasons for wanting a certain thing
are often complex, and before there can be a well-formed <span
class="wikiword">[DesiredState](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Consulting.DesiredState?action=print)</span>
(see also <span
class="wikiword">[WellFormedOutcomes](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Consulting.WellFormedOutcomes?action=print)</span>),
we must know the reasons why the client wants what they want. <span

Sometimes the client doesn't know why they want something. This is why
it is important to couch the question the way it is written. Simply
asking "Why do you want that?" (see <span
class="wikiword">[NeverAskWhy](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Consulting.NeverAskWhy?action=edit)[?](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Consulting.NeverAskWhy?action=edit)</span>)
leaves things far too open for the client to give any answer. The
question, as written, will direct the client to think of outcomes, which
is what we want here.

It is also useful to explore this territory for awhile. Ask the question
at least three times or until you get a business reason, as opposed to a
procedural or technical reason.

Some other ways to ask the question include:
--------------------------------------------

-   What will you be able to do when you have that?
-   What is even more important than having that?
-   What problem does having that solve for you?

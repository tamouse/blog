Abstract: Unlike the traditional factors of production--land, labor, and
capital--knowledge is a resource that can't be forced out of people. But
creating and sharing knowledge is essential to fostering innovation, the
key challenge of the knowledge-based economy. To create a climate in
which employees volunteer their creativity and expertise, managers need
to look beyond the traditional tools at their disposal. They need to
build trust. The authors have studied the links between trust, idea
sharing, and corporate performance for more than a decade. They offer an
explanation for why people resist change even when it would benefit them
directly. In every case, the decisive factor was what the authors call
fair process--fairness in the way a company makes and executes
decisions. Fair process may sound like a soft issue, but it is crucial
to building trust and unlocking ideas.

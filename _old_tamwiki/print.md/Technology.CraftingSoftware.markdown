What I do for my living is write software, aka, programming computers. I
have been doing this for a long, long time! I wrote my first BASIC
computer program when I was between 6th and 7th grades in summer school,
using an old TTY33 teletype with punched paper tape, talking to an
HP2000 BASIC OS computer that was at the school district office. This
was exciting! I eventually wrote a lunar lander program that summer.

Since then, I've rather stuck with it. Although I began my university
study in EE, by the 3rd year, I switched completely to CS as it was so
much more fun!

I've written in many
[Languages](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Technology.Languages?action=print),
and done a whole lot of different things.

Over the course of these many years, I've learned quite a lot about the
practice of programming, which I will attempt to share here some
insights.

[Thoughts on the idea of software development
craftsmanship](http://tamouse.org/2012/12/04/code-as-literature-software-dev-as-communication/) --
a blog post I wrote capturing a rambling monologue on irc on my thoughts
about software development as a craft, and code as literature.

These are the current topics:

hope you find them interesting and useful.

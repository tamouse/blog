It was a spectacularly beautiful Saturday in San Francisco. Exactly the
perfect day to do some field usability testing. But this was no ordinary
field usability test. Sure, there'd been plenty of planning and
organizing ahead of time. And there would be data analysis afterward.
What made this test different from most usability tests?

<div class="vspace">

-   16 people gathered to make 6 research teams
-   Most of the people on the teams had never met
-   Some of the research teams had people who had never taken part in
    usability testing before
-   The teams were going to intercept people on the street, at
    libraries, in farmers-markets

Ever heard of [Improv Everywhere](http://improveverywhere.com/)? This
was the UX equivalent. Researchers just appeared out of the crowd to ask
people to try out a couple of designs and then talk about their
experiences. Most of the interactions with participants were about 20
minutes long. That's it. But by the time the sun was over the yardarm
(time for cocktails, that is), we had data on two designs from 40
participants. The day was amazingly energizing.

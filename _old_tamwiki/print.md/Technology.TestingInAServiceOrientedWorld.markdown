Testing In A Service Oriented World
-----------------------------------

*Abstract:* Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is the latest attempt to
better link the business with technology. Testing a SOA applications
become more and more complex, as it should be continuous, not just in
development and integration, but in deployment, because an SOA by nature
is never a static application. Even if each service in a SOA application
is tested thoroughly and carefully the quality of the final application
may suffer because testing is not enough after the integration of the
services. This article presents the challenges and problems that test
teams experience when testing SOA applications. It also summarizes how
the testing of SOA is carried out now and gives some ideas on further
improvements. Key words: testing, SOA, ESB, services, monitoring SOA

Abstract:
---------

In the study reported here, we tested the novel
sexualized-body-inversion hypothesis. Integrating research and theory on
objectification and person versus object recognition, we examined
whether sexualized women, but not sexualized men, are recognized in the
same way as objects are. According to objectification theory
(Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997), female bodies are scrutinized and
evaluated to a greater degree than male bodies are, which leads to
sexual objectification of women. Defined as viewing or treating an
individual as a sexualized body, or as sexualized body parts, available
for satisfying the needs and desires of other people (Bartky, 1990),
sexual objectification has been recently operationalized by portraying
the target wearing underwear or a swimsuit.

Sexual objectification is related to decreased mind attribution
(Loughnan et al., 2010), diminished agency perception (Cikara,
Eberhardt, & Fiske, 2010), and dehumanization (Vaes, Paladino, & Puvia,
2011). Moreover, Heflick and Goldenberg (2009) have shown that focusing
on targets?? appearance, rather than on their personality, could
diminish the degree of human nature attributed to female targets but not
to male targets (attribution of human nature is a critical dimension of
social perception that allows people to differentiate humans from
objects; Loughnan & Haslam, 2007). Furthermore, sexual objectification
generally has more adverse consequences for females than for males
(Gervais, Vescio, & Allen, 2011a; Moradi & Huang, 2008; Saguy, Quinn, ??

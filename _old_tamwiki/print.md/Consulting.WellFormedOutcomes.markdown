Well-Formed Outcomes
--------------------

<span id="excerpt"></span> In building a <span
class="wikiword">[DesiredState](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Consulting.DesiredState?action=print)</span>,
the quality of the description of the outcomes is important to being
able to achieve them. <span id="excerptend"></span>

**Assertion:** quality of life is dependent upon achieving one's
outcomes in life.

**Assertion:** the quality (value to the person requesting something) of
one's outcomes is in direct proportion to the *well-formedness* of the
outcome.

Outcomes have the following properties. All of these are necessary in
order to make the outcome well-formed.

<div class="vspace">

</div>

Specificity
:   precisely stated action to be performed and result desired from the
    action. Specific as to outcome, form, place, time, cost, value,
    person(s):

    outcome
    :   what is the desired result from the action? The outcome itself
        must be stated. A complete picture of the <span
        class="wikiword">[DesiredState](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Consulting.DesiredState?action=print)</span>
        of the requestor is most useful.

    form
    :   what form will the result be needed in?

    place
    :   where will the action be performed and where will the result be
        delivered?

    time
    :   when is the result needed and how much time can the action take?

    cost
    :   what is the budget for carrying out the action and the cost of
        materials for the result?

    value
    :   how will the person performing the commitment be compensated and
        how will the requestor be using the result in future work?

    person
    :   who is making the request, the commitment response, carrying out
        the action, delivering the result, receiving the result, and
        using the result?

    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

Obtainability
:   the result must be able to be achieved by the person(s) within the
    specifications made.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

Positive
:   the commitment is for what is wanted, not what is not wanted. There
    are no statements of the form "Don't do ..." or "I don't want...". A
    positive outcome is easier and richer to specify than the list of
    things it isn't supposed to be.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

Appropriate chunk size
:   the result requested can be negotiated in a single setting. The
    requestor must be able to use the result delivered
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

Ecological
:   the outcome is not harmful to any of those involved, and furthers
    the goals and needs of the requestor.

Leopard and Rat
===============

The extraordinary scene was captured by photography student Casey
Gutteridge at the Santago Rare Leopard Project in Hertfordshire.

Casey was astounded by the mouse's behavior. He said: "I have no idea
where the mouse came from - he just appeared in the enclosure after the
keeper had dropped in the meat for the leopard."

"He didn't take any notice of the leopard, just went straight over to
the meat and started feeding. But the leopard was pretty surprised, she
bent down and sniffed the mouse and flinched a bit like she was scared.
In the meantime the mouse just carried on eating like nothing had
happened." She gave him a shove with her nose, but even a gentle shove
does not deter the little creature from getting his fill."

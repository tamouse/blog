Teaching through Stories
------------------------

<div class="round lrindent quote">

"I have become acutely aware, through teaching, of the power of the
individual narrative of having gone out to a place that is very
different from here and lived with people who are different from my
students. If I tell stories in the course of teaching an anthropology
class, students will include on their evaluations that they wished I had
told more stories from my personal experience. I have come to realize to
what myth this is playing and have come to question the practice. It is
a good way to get students attention, but do they get the points I am
trying to make or does it come across as just another frontier
story?" -- Vance Geiger

Stories and Metaphors are the most powerful communication tools we have
to convey concepts, ideas, and beliefs. We use stories in our consulting
and partnership workshops, in addition to other workshops, events,
interactions, etc., that we do with our clients.

The use of a metaphor goes around most people's objections to being told
something straight on. Plus, it is fun!

<span style="color: green;"> **Update:** </span> No longer in FA.

<span class="round lrindent important2"> FA is a very difficult and
demanding program. It isn't for everyone. There are factions that will
not let you take psych medications and participate in certain programs.
This is a very dangerous thing!!</span>

Food Addicts In Recovery Anonymous, aka "FA", is a 12-step program
designed to give people who have little or no control over their eating
the discipline needed to eat well. FA is an offshoot of Overeaters
Anonymous, via 90-day OA and something that people pronounce like
"how" -- I don't know anything about the latter.

The main reason I sought FA was on a recommendation from my therapist.
My blood sugars were topping 220 and staying high. I was desperate to
drop them. The next step would have been to put me on insulin, which I
wanted to avoid if at all possible. She said she had a couple of other
clients who benefitted greatly from FA and thought the discipline would
do me good in my general overall healing processes as well.

FA is working well for me. I started the program September 10th at 297
lbs, dropped to 291 by the 4th day after starting, and as of January
1st, 2005, have lost a total of 47 pounds, a little over 10 pounds a
month. If I can maintain the weight loss of 10 pounds per month, I will
be at my goal weight in 7 months. The main reason remains getting my
blood sugars down, however. I'm happy to say that on that 4th day
weigh-in at 291 I was at the diabetologist's office and my morning
fasting reading had been 105! She immediately cut one of my medications
in half, which is decidedly the direction I'd like to be going, down
rather than up!

Here is my progress to date re: weight loss:

In FA, we only weigh ourselves once a month.

FA combines a food plan that is pretty strict with other disciplines.
Here's what my day is like:

<div class="vspace">

</div>

1.  at 5:30 am, I get up, get on my knees and pray to my Higher Power
    for an abstinent day and any other help I am going to need that day
2.  shower and get dressed
3.  read the daily page from the book \_24 Hours A Day\_
4.  spend a half an hour in quiet meditation seeking my Higher Power and
    to quiet my mind
5.  at 6:45 am spend 15 minutes on the phone giving my sponsor my food
    plan for the day
6.  eat an abstinent breakfast consisting of 8 ounces of plain, non-fat
    yogurt, 6 ounces or 1 piece of fresh fruit, and 1 ounce of oatmeal
7.  at noon, I eat an abstinent lunch consisting of 4 ounces of protein,
    8 ounces of a raw vegetable (garden salad) with 1 Tbsp oil, and 1
    small piece of fruit (6 oz)
8.  sometime during the day, I make 3 outreach phone calls to people in
    the program, only counting live people, not answering machines
9.  at 6 pm, I eat an abstinent dinner consisting of again 4 ounces of
    protein, 6 ounces of a cooked vegetable, and 8 ounces of raw
    vegetables (garden salad) with \# Tbsp oil
10. at night, I prepare my meal plan for the next day
11. I write in my journal
12. I read 2 pages from the Big Book of \_Alcoholics Anonymous\_
13. go to sleep by 10 pm

While traditional approaches to maximizing employee creativity have
focused on hiring creative people, more recent perspectives suggest that
employees' work environments influence the creativity of their
contributions. This article discusses the benefits of integrating these
approaches. To ensure the most creative work from employees, managers
need to assess the creative potential of each person and then place
those with high potential into work contexts that stimulate and nurture
it. When firms place people with high creative potential in contexts
that offer complex job assignments, supportive and non-controlling
supervision, and competitive co-workers, they reap the benefits of
maximum employee creativity.

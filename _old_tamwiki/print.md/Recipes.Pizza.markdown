<span id="toc1"></span>Introduction
-----------------------------------

I ***LOVE*** pizza, love it to death. I am probably addicted to it, in
fact. I like pizza hot, cold, room temperature, new, old (well, not
*too* old), american^[1](#fn1_1)^<span id="fnr1_1"></span>, european,
neopolitan^[2](#fn1_2)^<span id="fnr1_2"></span>,
australian^[3](#fn1_3)^<span id="fnr1_3"></span>, you name it, if I've
been somewhere, I've had pizza there. Even when I went to Thailand with
a friend, they had Pizza Hut! Although Thai is probably my *second*
favourite food, I'd rather eat Thai food in Thailand than Pizza Hut
Pizza in Thailand. シ

<span id="toc3"></span>Enhancing Store-bought frozen and fresh pizza
--------------------------------------------------------------------

You know, I'm not above buying a frozen or uncooked pizza, such as from
Papa Murphy's. But I don't just leave it as it's packaged. Even the most
mundane frozen pizza can be improved upon. Typically I add:

-   Basil
-   Oregano
-   Ground Pepper
-   Garlic powder
-   Mushrooms
-   For my folks, I'll put black olives on their part, but I'm not
    having anything to do with them!

On occasion, I'll even throw on:

-   Chopped sun-dried tomatoes
-   Chopped, cooked bacon
-   Chopped onion (vidalia, red, yellow)
-   Extra cheese (mozarella, monterey jack, parmesean)

Some people like marinated artichoke hearts, but I'm allergic to them.

***No fish!!*** (if you want anchovies on *your* pizza fine, but I'm not
sharing it) (Fish include any kind of sea food: anchovies, mackeral,
salmon, shrimp, lobster, clams, oysters -- I'm having none of it!)

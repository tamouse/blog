Strong passwords

The role that passwords play in securing an [application] is often
underestimated and overlooked. Passwords provide the first line of
defense against unauthorized access to your organization.

Weak passwords provide attackers with easy access to your computers and
network, while strong passwords are considerably harder to crack, even
with the password-cracking software that is available today.
Password-cracking tools continue to improve, and the computers that are
used to crack passwords are more powerful than ever. Password-cracking
software uses one of three approaches: intelligent guessing, dictionary
attacks, and brute-force automated attacks that try every possible
combination of characters. Given enough time, the automated method can
crack any password. However, strong passwords are much harder to crack
than weak passwords. A secure computer has strong passwords for all user
accounts.

A weak password:

<div class="vspace">

</div>

-   Is no password at all.
-   Contains your user name, real name, or company name.
-   Contains a complete dictionary word. For example, Password is a weak
    password.

A strong password:

<div class="vspace">

</div>

-   Is at least seven characters long.
-   Does not contain your user name, real name, or company name.
-   Does not contain a complete dictionary word.
-   Is significantly different from previous passwords. Passwords that
    increment (Password1, Password2, Password3 ...) are not strong.
-   Contains characters from each of the following four groups:

  Uppercase letters                                                                            A, B, C ??
  Lowercase letters                                                                            a, b, c ??
  Numerals                                                                                     0, 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
  Symbols found on the keyboard (all keyboard characters not defined as letters or numerals)   \` \~ ! @ \# \$ % \^ & \* ( ) \_ + - = { } | \\ : " ; ' \< \> ? , . /

An example of a strong password is `J*p2leO4>F`{.escaped}.

A password can meet most of the criteria of a strong password but still
be rather weak. For example, Hello2U! is a relatively weak password even
though it meets most of the criteria for a strong password and also
meets the complexity requirements of password policy. H!elZl2o is a
strong password because the dictionary word is interspersed with
symbols, numbers, and other letters. It is important to educate users
about the benefits of using strong passwords and to teach them how to
create passwords that are actually strong.

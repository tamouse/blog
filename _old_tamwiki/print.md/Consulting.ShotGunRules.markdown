<div id="wikitext">

<span id="excerpt"></span> I came across this list of rules. It's used
by a computer group but it fits very well with any other loose-knit
organization that stays in contact via email. It's worth a read but if
you use it, note the copyright requirements at the end:

[NOTE: This list of rules is a general template for defining in-person
meetings of loosely-connected email lists without a central organizing
authority. To use it, replace the markers "{name-of-list}" with the name
of your email list or group, and change the date recurrence in rule 1.
Publish the modified rules on your email list or Web site.

You can and should remove this note, but not the copyright notice at the

Shotgun Rules For {Name-Of-List} Meetings
-----------------------------------------

Rule 1
:   Each {week|month}, the {name-of-list} meeting will be on {the 2nd
    Wednesday of the month|Sunday night|the 4th|full moon|whenever}.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

Rule 2
:   Determination for the location for the {name-of-list} meeting is
    like calling shotgun for the front passenger seat of a car. Whoever
    calls the location first, wins, and that's where {name-of-list} is
    going to be, period. In case of close calls, "first" is determined
    by date received by the list server machine, and ties go to the
    runner.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

Rule 3
:   A meeting announcement must be posted by email to the {name-of-list}
    list, with the word "ANNOUNCEMENT" in the Subject header. It must
    define a time, a location (with address and/or directions by car and
    public transportation), and use the declarative voice ("We are going
    to..." not "Would you guys like to go to...?"). It should not be
    sent before the previous {week|month}'s meeting has happened (or
    should have happened).
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

Rule 4
:   If you make the announcement, you have to go, you have to be on time
    and preferably early, and you have to make a little sign that says
    "{name-of-list}" so people know where they're supposed to sit.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

Rule 5
:   If no one makes an announcement, the meeting will not happen. If
    nobody cares enough to take responsibility and make an announcement,
    and everyone minces around with do-you-think's and
    what-about-this's, we are weak and cowardly and do not deserve a
    lovely meeting together.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

Rule 6
:   Nobody is making you go to {name-of-list} meetings. Your dialysis
    machine is not at the {name-of-list} meeting. You are not a robot of
    the future who will be stuck in our dimension forever if you don't
    attend the {name-of-list} meeting.

<div class="vspace">

</div>

<div class="indent">

If, for some reason, you cannot make it to the {name-of-list} meeting,
or you don't like where it's being held, or Chinese food gives you an
upset tummy, then Don't Go, and make a note in your calendar to yourself
to take some initiative and make the next month's announcement.

</div>

<div class="vspace">

</div>

Rule 7
:   In case of SEVERE HAZARD -- for example, the originally chosen venue
    has burnt to the ground or is on fire at the scheduled time for the
    meeting, etc. -- the original organizer should post a new
    announcement according to rule 3, mentioning prominently that it is
    a change.

<div class="vspace">

</div>

<div class="indent">

The organizer MUST put a sign and/or a human runner at the original
venue to send people who missed the revised announcement to the new
location.

</div>

<div class="vspace">

</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's it. 7 simple rules. The Date Rule, the Shotgun Rule, the Email
Rule, the Organizer Rule, the Have a Spine Rule, the Take Your Lumps
Rule, and the System Crash Rule.

Now, as another reminder, here's the non-binding part.

<div class="vspace">

</div>

Good locations for a {name-of-list} meeting will have:
------------------------------------------------------

-   Food
-   Cheap food
-   Good food
-   Alcoholic beverages
-   Non-alcoholic beverages
-   Access for minors and people under 21
-   Separate checks
-   Seats for 10-30 people
-   Room to push tables together, or pull them apart
-   Forgiveness for people coming and leaving at will
-   Something for vegetarians to eat
-   Something for carnivores to eat
-   Enough quiet that we can talk
-   Enough loudness that we're not a big distraction
-   Enough light that we can see the network diagrams we're drawing on
    the backs of napkins
-   Access by public transportation
-   Access by car
-   Nearby parking
-   Easy directions

Obviously, there's no requirement that every location have all these
things, and most locations won't. And you are the sole determiner of
where everyone goes: you can call the meeting for a XXX movie theater or
your own home or a cardboard box under the freeway. But it'd be nice to
meet these goals.

<div class="vspace">

</div>

-   Restaurants and cafes that have been historically supportive of our
    cause deserve our business and dollars.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

-   A good time for meeting is A) late enough that people can get off
    work and drive or ride from their region to the region the meeting
    is in, and B) not so late that the place is going to close, or
    people have to go home for sleep. Think 7-8PM.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

-   If you think you know a good place to go, announce it. If you don't,
    shut up. When people post do-you-think's and what-about-this's, it
    clouds the waters and everyone gets confused. So don't do that.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

-   If for some reason you are far outside the preferred region of the
    meeting, you should think about starting an offshoot group and
    having separate meetings.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

-   A good meeting attendee will bring money for their share of food and
    drink if they can. If they can't, they will keep their grubby mitts
    off the food and drink. If they share from common food or drink
    (such as pizzas or fries or pitchers of beer), they will get up and
    get another pizza or basket of fries or pitcher or whatever when the
    current one runs out. They will chip in for what they ate, and pay
    for what they ordered, and remember the tip, and round up rather
    than down.
    <div class="vspace">

-   A sample announcement email would look like this:

-   There is no shame in announcing the meeting for someplace that
    {name-of-list} has already been before. Heck: if it was good enough
    before, it's probably good enough now.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

-   If you make an announcement, it's entirely possible that NO ONE will
    come. This is the risk you run. You have put yourself on the line,
    and it's within the realm of likelihood that you will spend the
    night lonely and afraid, standing naked in the rain while fire ants
    crawl on your legs and chomp your skin and all of the people you
    have ever had secret crushes on point at you and laugh and laugh.
    \\\\ \\\\ In short, it will be the worst night of your entire life,
    bar none. If you are prepared for this, any other outcome will be
    icing on the cake. \\\\ \\\\ If you are not prepared for this, and
    you send a vituperative and bitter email to the {name-of-list} list
    on the Day After, you will come off like a fool, and you will have
    capped your disastrous event with a bitter and ugly conclusion. This
    is not smart, so don't do that.

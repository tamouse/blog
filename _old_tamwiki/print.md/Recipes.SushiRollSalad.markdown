Sushi Roll??Salad
=================

June 11, 2012

I love **sushi**, so I was naturally drawn to a **Gourmet** recipe on
**epicurious** for ["California Roll"
Salad](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/-California-Roll-Salad-12246).
I made a few changes and came up with this **Sushi Roll Salad** to take
to a potluck party.

The original recipe uses long grain rice. I used a Japanese brand of
**medium grain *(sushi)* rice** because I thought it would be more
authentic. It was very good, and it *is* the rice used in sushi, but I
think I would use long grain rice next time. The texture of long grain
rice might be a bit better in a salad. Many of the reviewers *raved*
about their results with **Jasmine rice**, so that may be the way to go.

**California Rolls** typically are made with **cucumber**, **avocado**,
and **surimi**. Surimi is also known as "imitation crab", "mock crab",
or sometimes "Krab". It's made from white fish, often pollock, and quite
a list of additives to make an inexpensive substitute for crab. The
Gourmet recipe included the option of adding surimi to the salad, but
pointed out that the recipe can be successfully made without the surimi
for a vegetarian version.

I thought about making a vegetarian version since I don't like using
surimi, but I liked the idea of using some kind of seafood. I chose
**fresh Oregon shrimp meat** and I think it worked really well!

I used 50% more wasabi and ginger juice in the dressing, and I'm glad I
did. As one who likes the spicy Maki rolls, I thought it was mild but
the flavors were still distinct. A couple of people told me that they
liked the fact that it wasn't "too spicy". If I make it again for a
party, I will probably make it with the same dressing, but have some
extra wasabi and ginger on the side for people to add to their servings
if they like it spicier.

Despite the fact that I would try a different type of rice next time, I
*really* liked this **Sushi Roll Salad**. Several people at the party
told me how much they enjoyed it.

Bob, my ever-willing in-house taste tester, said he didn't think it was
good enough to be "blog-worthy". I disagreed, suggesting that perhaps he
felt that way because he's not that crazy about sushi. He admitted that
his indifference towards sushi could have influenced his opinion. *Well,
I am* ***crazy about sushi***, and I loved this salad! If you're crazy
about sushi, you may love it, too!

Sushi Roll Salad

*(Adapted from a July 1994 Gourmet recipe on epicurious.com)*

**Serves 8 as a side dish** *(Cut the recipe in half for fewer servings
because it won't keep too well.)*

*I used, and photographed, medium grain sushi rice. I suggest that you
try the recipe with long grain rice, perhaps the Jasmine variety.*

Directions
----------

1.  Wash the rice in several rinses of cold water to remove some of the
    starch. The water will be quite cloudy at first and become clearer
    as you continue to rinse it.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

2.  Cook the rice using your favorite method. I used my rice cooker with
    1½ cups plus 2 tablespoons water.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

3.  While the rice is cooking, put the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in
    a small saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook just until the sugar is
    dissolved. Remove from the heat.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

4.  Toast the sesame seeds in a small pan, stirring often, until they
    are golden brown. Remove the seeds from the pan and set aside.

1.  When the rice is done, put it in a large bowl and allow it to cool.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

2.  Gently stir, using kind of a folding motion so you don??€™t break up
    the rice too much, the sesame seeds, oil, ginger, green onions,
    carrot, and cucumber into the salad.

*(The salad can be covered and refrigerated at this point for up to a
day. Bring to room temperature before continuing with the recipe.)*

1.  Make the dressing. Stir all of the dressing ingredients together in
    a small bowl until well-combined.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

2.  Cut the nori into thin strips and then cut the strips into small
    pieces, about 1%frac12; to 2 inches long. Kitchen scissors probably
    work best for this.

1.  Cut the avocado into small cubes and gently toss them with the lime
    juice. *(This helps to keep the avocado from turning brown.)*

2.  Gently toss the avocado, shrimp, and the dressing into the salad.

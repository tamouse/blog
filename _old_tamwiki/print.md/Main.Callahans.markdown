**Callahan's** is a mythical bar set in New York State, invented by
[Spider Robinson](http://www.spiderrobinson.com/) in a series of
[books](http://tinyurl.com/3jw7z). The proprieter, one Michael Callahan,
runs the place. Drinks are \$0.50, but you have to pay \$1 at a time. If
you finish your drink, you can toast something and throw your glass into
the fireplace for that extra \$0.50. At the end of the night, a box of
quarters is laid out and you can collect your change. Almost no one
takes any change.

Callahan's is about sharing pain, which is lessened, sharing joy, which
is increased, and thus refuting the laws of entropy.

There are various Callahan's on the net:

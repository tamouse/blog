Chef Cole Dickinson, Michael Voltaggio??s sous chef at the restaurant
Ink in Los Angeles, shared with us his recipe for a Dutch Baby modeled
after one from his childhood. ??My mother was a single mom raising three
kids,?? he says. ??She made Dutch babies because they were
affordable??and always made us feel special. Today, they??re something
we all associate with special occasions and happy times.??

A Dutch baby is a cross between a souffl?? and an omelette. It is
oven-baked in a hot fry pan rather than cooked on the stovetop, ensuring
a light, fluffy rise with a deliciously crisp edge. Dickinson??s version
is topped with a bacon-maple syrup and dollop of whipped cream.

Variations
----------

The original W-S recipe calls for heavy cream and confectioner's sugar
to make whipped cream. Not really part of the recipe proper, but whipped
cream is a nice thing to have on the dutch baby.

The recipe also called for bacon and a maple syrup reduction. Omitted
this as well as being a bit *trop*.

Putting a squeeze of lemon juice on the serving and dusting with
confectioner's sugar is the usual way I eat these.

<span id="excerpt"></span> [Alan] has co-authored several best selling
guidebooks for amateur astronomers, including, with Terence Dickinson,
The Backyard Astronomer??s Guide, reprinted and revised in 2010 (Firefly
Books). He is also author of several children??s book on space, notably
Insiders: Space and Mission to the Moon, both for Simon and Schuster. A
new kids book about Stars is due out in 2011. I also contributed
sections to National Geographic??s Backyard Guide to the Night Sky.

[Alan] is a frequent guest expert on local and national news media. As
an amateur astronomer, his interests include astrophotography and
deep-sky observing (he compiled some of the popular deep-sky observing
lists in the annual RASC Observer??s Handbook).

Alan takes the opportunity as often as possible to visit the southern
hemisphere to pursue both observing and photography under southern
skies. His other obsession, eclipse chasing, has taken him to every
continent, chalking up 13 total solar eclipses ?? \#14 will be in
Australia in 2012. Asteroid 78434 is named for him.

Ingredients
-----------

-   ~~2~~ 6 cups peeled and shredded potatoes
-   ~~1/2~~ 1/3 cup melted butter
-   2 eggs, beaten
-   1 teaspoon minced onion *(I think here they mean the dried minced
    onion you buy in bottles. I would never put raw onion in this.)*
-   ~~1 teaspoon salt~~ *(This seems like a lot of salt initially for 2
    cups shredded potatoes, but maybe for the OP the salt gets obsorbed.
    I would only salt this to taste, and add a healthy dose of pepper as
    well)*
-   1/4 teaspoon paprika
-   1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
-   1/2 cup milk
-   1/2 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Variations
----------

Fabulous, but only 4 stars because I had to tweak A LOT! Follow these
instructions and you'll love it too. First cook at 400 not 350. Increase
shredded potatoes to SIX CUPS and reduce your butter to 1/3 cup. I
didn't have paprika so I used 1 tsp of garlic spread mix and a dash of
pepper...yum! Cook for the 40 minutes then put it under low broil for 5
minutes to crisp the top (watch it so you don't overdo it). Pull it out,
add your chedder and back in the oven just till melted. Take it out and
let it "rest" for 5 minutes before eating. (This gives the butter a
little time to absorb because you will see some in there when you pull
it out. My hubby and 3 girls devoured this and was so sad I didn't make
a bigger batch! I served it with pork chops and veggies. Sooo good!

Comments

I would go ahead an follow the comments from the reviewer above. The
initial ingredients don't seem right, exactly. Definitely more potatoes,
less fat, less salt, more pepper. Consider also mixing in some of the
grated cheddar, not just sprinkling it on top.

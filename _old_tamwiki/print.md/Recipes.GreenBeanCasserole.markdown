The standard GBC is pretty basic: couple of cans of green beans, can of
mushroom soup, top with french fried onion strings. This retains only
some of that, but makes it into something more than a quick toss
together, with some substance.

<span id="fn1_1"></span>^1^ Sometime, I'm going to do this with a
regular white sauce and some other flavourings rather than use the
tinned soup. This is not that year. [⇑](#fnr1_1)

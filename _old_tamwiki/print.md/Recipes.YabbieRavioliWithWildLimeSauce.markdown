Ravioli
-------

-   30 yabbies (5 portions)
-   100g leeks, julienne cut
-   wine glass of Vermouth
-   salt and pepper
-   60 wonton skins
-   egg white

Drop the live yabbies into a large volume of boiling water to quickly
kill them. Drain and transfer to iced water to chill totally. Remove the
flesh from the tail and discard the alimentary canal. Saut?? the
julienne leek in a little butter, add the yabby tails and Vermouth. Toss
frequently until all the liquid has evaporated and flavoured the yabbies
which should be half cooked at this stage. Remove yabbies and leeks and
set aside to cool. Place one yabby tail and a little of the leek onto a
wonton wrapper. Brush the wrapper around the yabby with egg white and
set another wonton skin on top of the yabby squeezing out any gaps.
Using a round cutter, cut out a circle keeping the yabby in the centre
or alternatively, leave square. Put aside under a damp tea towel until
ready to cook.

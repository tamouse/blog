Over the past two months NASA has been releasing a number of wonderful
long exposure photographs taken by astronaut [Don
Pettit](https://twitter.com/#!/astro_Pettit) aboard the International
Space Station. While there are many photos like these taken from the
perspective of the Earth??s surface, Pettit??s images are unique in that
they incorporate the passing blur of entire illuminated cities, aurora,
and the sporadic flashes of lightening from thunderstorms. Check out
many more photos from the series

(<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563212000143>)

Abstract: The effectiveness of a game-based cognitive training
intervention on multiple abilities was assessed in a sample of 39 older
adults aged 60â€“77. The intervention task was chosen based on a cognitive
task analysis designed to determine the attentional and multi-modal
demands of the game. Improvements on a measure of attention were found
for the intervention group compared to controls. Furthermore, for the
intervention group only, initial ability scores predicted improvements
on both tests of attention and spatial orientation. These results
suggest cognitive training may be more effective for those initially
lower in ability.

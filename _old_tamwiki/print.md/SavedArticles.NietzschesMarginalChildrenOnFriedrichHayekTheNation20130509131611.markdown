In the last half-century of American politics, conservatism has hardened
around the defense of economic privilege and rule. Whether it’s the
libertarianism of the GOP or the neoliberalism of the Democrats, that
defense has enabled an upward redistribution of rights and a downward
redistribution of duties. The 1 percent possesses more than wealth and
political influence; it wields direct and personal power over men and
women. Capital governs labor, telling workers what to say, how to vote
and when to pee. It has all the substance of *noblesse* and none of the
style of *oblige*. That many of its most vocal defenders believe Barack
Obama to be their mortal enemy—a socialist, no less—is a testament less
to the reality about which they speak than to the resonance of the
vocabulary they deploy.

The Nobel Prize–winning economist Friedrich Hayek is the leading
theoretician of this movement, formulating the most genuinely political
theory of capitalism on the right we’ve ever seen. The theory does not
imagine a shift from government to the individual, as is often claimed
by conservatives; nor does it imagine a simple shift from the state to
the market or from society to the atomized self, as is sometimes claimed
by the left. Rather, it recasts our understanding of politics and where
it might be found. This may explain why the University of Chicago chose
to reissue Hayek’s *The Constitution of Liberty* two years ago after the
fiftieth anniversary of its publication. Like *The Road to Serfdom*
(1944), which a swooning Glenn Beck catapulted to the bestseller list in
2010, *The Constitution of Liberty* is a text, as its publisher says, of
“our present moment.”

But to understand that text and its influence, it’s necessary to turn
away from contemporary America to *fin de siècle* Vienna. The seedbed of
Hayek’s arguments is the half-century between the “marginal revolution,”
which changed the field of economics in the late nineteenth century, and
the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy in 1918. It is by now a
commonplace of European cultural history that a dying Austro-Hungarian
Empire gave birth to modernism, psychoanalysis and fascism. Yet from the
vortex of Vienna came not only Wittgenstein, Freud and Hitler but also
Hayek, who was born and educated in the city, and the Austrian school of
economics.

Friedrich Nietzsche figures critically in this story, less as an
influence than a diagnostician. This will strike some as an improbable
claim: Wasn’t Nietzsche contemptuous of capitalists, capitalism and
economics? Yes, he was, and for all his reading in political economy, he
never wrote a treatise on politics or economics. And despite the long
shadow he cast over the Viennese avant-garde, he is hardly ever cited by
the economists of the Austrian school.

Yet no one understood better than Nietzsche the social and cultural
forces that would shape the Austrians: the demise of an ancient ruling
class; the raising of the labor question by trade unions and socialist
parties; the inability of an ascendant bourgeoisie to crush or contain
democracy in the streets; the need for a new ruling class in an age of
mass politics. The relationship between Nietzsche and the free-market
right—which has been seeking to put labor back in its box since the
nineteenth century, and now, with the help of the neoliberal left, has
succeeded—is thus one of elective affinity rather than direct influence,
at the level of idiom rather than policy.

“One day,” Nietzsche wrote in *Ecce Homo*, “my name will be associated
with the memory of something tremendous, a crisis without equal on
earth, the most profound collision of conscience.” It is one of the
ironies of intellectual history that the terms of the collision can best
be seen in the rise of a discourse that Nietzsche, in all likelihood,
would have despised.

-   \* \*

In 1869, Nietzsche was appointed professor of classical philology at
Basel University. Like most junior faculty, he was bedeviled by meager
wages and bore major responsibilities, such as teaching fourteen hours a
week, Monday through Friday, beginning at 7 am. He also sat on multiple
committees and covered for senior colleagues who couldn’t make their
classes. He lectured to the public on behalf of the university. He
dragged himself to dinner parties. Yet within three years he managed to
complete *The Birth of Tragedy*, a minor masterwork of modern
literature, which he dedicated to his close friend and “sublime
predecessor” Richard Wagner.

One chapter, however, he withheld from publication. In 1872, Nietzsche
was invited to spend the Christmas holidays with Wagner and his wife
Cosima, but sensing a potential rift with the composer, he begged off
and sent a gift instead. He bundled “The Greek State” with four other
essays, slapped a title onto a cover page (*Five Prefaces to Five
Unwritten Books*), and mailed the leather-bound text to Cosima as a
birthday present. Richard was offended; Cosima, unimpressed. “Prof.
Nietzsche’s manuscript does not restore our spirits,” she sniffed in her
diary.

Though presented as a sop to a fraying friendship, “The Greek State”
reflects the larger European crisis of war and revolution that had begun
in 1789 and would come to an end only in 1945. More immediately, it
bears the stamp of the Franco-Prussian War, which had broken out in
1870, and the Paris Commune, which was declared the following year.

Initially ambivalent about the war, Nietzsche quickly became a partisan
of the German cause. “It’s about our culture!” he wrote to his mother.
“And for that no sacrifice is too great! This damned French tiger.” He
signed up to serve as a medical orderly; Cosima tried to persuade him to
stay put in Basel, recommending that he send cigarettes to the front
instead. But Nietzsche was adamant. In August 1870, he left for Bavaria
with his sister Elisabeth, riding the rails and singing songs. He got
his training, headed to the battlefield, and in no time contracted
dysentery and diphtheria. He lasted a month.

The war lasted for six. A half-million soldiers were killed or wounded,
as were countless civilians. The preliminary peace treaty, signed in
February 1871, favored the Germans and punished the French, particularly
the citizens of Paris, who were forced to shoulder the burden of heavy
indemnities to the Prussians. Enraged by its impositions—and a
quarter-century of simmering discontent and broken promises—workers and
radicals in Paris rose up and took over the city in March. Nietzsche was
scandalized, his horror at the revolt inversely proportional to his
exaltation over the war. Fearing that the Communards had destroyed the
Louvre (they hadn’t), he wrote:

<div class="vspace">

</div>

<div class="indent">

The reports of the past few days have been so awful that my state of
mind is altogether intolerable. What does it mean to be a scholar in the
face of such earthquakes of culture!… It is the worst day of my life.

</div>

In the quicksilver transmutation of a conventional war between states
into a civil war between classes, Nietzsche saw a terrible alchemy of
the future: “Over and above the struggle between nations the object of
our terror was that international hydra-head, suddenly and so
terrifyingly appearing as a sign of quite different struggles to come.”

By May, the Commune had been ruthlessly put down at the cost of tens of
thousands of lives—much to the delight of the Parisian
aesthete-aristocrat Edmond Goncourt:

<div class="vspace">

</div>

<div class="indent">

All is well. There has been neither compromise nor conciliation. The
solution has been brutal, imposed by sheer force of arms. The solution
has saved everyone from the dangers of cowardly compromise. The solution
has restored its self-confidence to the Army, which has learnt in the
blood of the Communards that it was still capable of fighting…a bleeding
like that, by killing the rebellious part of a population, postpones the
next revolution by a whole conscription.

</div>

Of the man who wrote these words and the literary milieu of which he was
a part, Nietzsche would later say: “I know these gentlemen inside out,
*so well* that I have really had enough of them already. One has to be
more radical: fundamentally they all lack the main thing—‘*la force*.’ ”

<div class="vspace">

The clash of these competing worlds of war and work echoes throughout
“The Greek State.” Nietzsche begins by announcing that the modern era is
dedicated to the “dignity of work.” Committed to “equal rights for all,”
democracy elevates the worker and the slave. Their demands for justice
threaten to “swamp all other ideas,” to tear “down the walls of
culture.” Modernity has made a monster in the working class: a created
creator (shades of Marx and Mary Shelley), it has the temerity to see
itself and its labor as a work of art. Even worse, it seeks to be
recognized and publicly acknowledged as such.

The Greeks, by contrast, saw work as a “disgrace,” because the existence
it serves—the finite life that each of us lives—“has no inherent value.”
Existence can be redeemed only by art, but art too is premised on work.
It is made, and its maker depends on the labor of others; they take care
of him and his household, freeing him from the burdens of everyday life.
Inevitably, his art bears the taint of their necessity. No matter how
beautiful, art cannot escape the pall of its creation. It arouses shame,
for in shame “there lurks the unconscious recognition that these
conditions” of work “are required for the actual goal” of art to be
achieved. For that reason, the Greeks properly kept labor and the
laborer hidden from view.

Throughout his writing life, Nietzsche was plagued by the vision of
workers massing on the public stage—whether in trade unions, socialist
parties or communist leagues. Almost immediately upon his arrival in
Basel, the First International descended on the city to hold its fourth
congress. Nietzsche was petrified. “There is nothing more terrible,” he
wrote in *The* *Birth of Tragedy*, “than a class of barbaric slaves who
have learned to regard their existence as an injustice, and now prepare
to avenge, not only themselves, but all generations.” Several years
after the International had left Basel, Nietzsche convinced himself that
it was slouching toward Bayreuth in order to ruin Wagner’s festival
there. And just weeks before he went mad in 1888 and disappeared forever
into his own head, he wrote, “The cause of every stupidity today…lies in
the existence of a labour question at all. About certain things one does
not ask questions.”

One can hear in the opening passages of “The Greek State” the pounding
march not only of European workers on the move but also of black slaves
in revolt. Hegel was brooding on Haiti while he worked out the
master-slave dialectic in *The* *Phenomenology of Spirit*. Though
generations of scholars have told us otherwise, perhaps Nietzsche had a
similar engagement in mind when he wrote, “Even if it were true that the
Greeks were ruined because they kept slaves, the opposite is even more
certain, that we will be destroyed because we fail to keep slaves.” What
theorist, after all, has ever pressed so urgently—not just in this essay
but in later works as well—the claim that “slavery belongs to the
essence of a culture”? What theorist ever had to? Before the eighteenth
century, bonded labor was an accepted fact. Now it was the subject of a
roiling debate, provoking revolutions and emancipations throughout the
world. Serfdom had been eliminated in Russia only a decade before—and in
some German states, only a generation before Nietzsche’s birth in
1844—while Brazil would soon become the last state in the Americas to
abolish slavery. An edifice of the ages had been brought down by a mere
century’s vibrations; is it so implausible that Nietzsche, attuned to
the vectors and velocity of decay as he was, would pause to record the
earthquake and insist on taking the full measure of its effects?

If slavery was one condition of great art, Nietzsche continued in “The
Greek State,” war and high politics were another. “Political men par
excellence,” the Greeks channeled their agonistic urges into bloody
conflicts between cities and less bloody conflicts within them: healthy
states were built on the repression and release of these impulses. The
arena for conflict created by that regimen gave “society time to
germinate and turn green everywhere” and allowed “blossoms of genius”
periodically to “sprout forth.” Those blossoms were not only artistic
but also political. Warfare sorted society into lower and higher ranks,
and from that hierarchy rose “the military genius,” whose artistry was
the state itself. The real dignity of man, Nietzsche insisted, lay not
in his lowly self but in the artistic and political genius his life was
meant to serve and on whose behalf it was to be expended.

Instead of the Greek state, however, Europe had the bourgeois state;
instead of aspiring to a work of art, states let markets do their work.
Politics, Nietzsche complained, had become “an instrument of the stock
exchange” rather than the terrain of heroism and glory. With the
“specifically political impulses” of Europe so weakened—even his beloved
Franco-Prussian War had not revived the spirit in the way that he had
hoped—Nietzsche could only “detect dangerous signs of atrophy in the
political sphere, equally worrying for art and society.” The age of
aristocratic culture and high politics was at an end. All that remained
was the detritus of the lower orders: the disgrace of the laborer, the
paper chase of the bourgeoisie, the barreling threat of socialism. “The
Paris commune,” Nietzsche would later write in his notebooks, “was
perhaps no more than minor indigestion compared to what is coming.”

Nietzsche had little, concretely, to offer as a counter-volley to
democracy, whether bourgeois or socialist. Despite his appreciation of
the political impulse and his studious attention to political events in
Germany—from the Schleswig-Holstein crisis of the early 1860s to the
imperial push of the late 1880s—he remained leery of programs, movements
and platforms. The best he could muster was a vague principle: that
society is “the continuing, painful birth of those exalted men of
culture in whose service everything else has to consume itself,” and the
state a “means of setting [that] process of society in motion and
guaranteeing its unobstructed continuation.” It was left to later
generations to figure out what that could mean in practice—and where it
might lead. Down one path might lay fascism; down another, the free
market.

Around the time—almost to the year—that Nietzsche was launching his
revolution of metaphysics and morals, a trio of economists, working
separately across three countries, were starting their own. It began
with the publication in 1871 of Carl Menger’s *Principles of Economics*
and William Stanley Jevons’s *The* *Theory of Political Economy*. Along
with Léon Walras’s *Elements of Pure Economics*, which appeared three
years later, these were the European faces—Austrian, English and
French-Swiss—of what would come to be called the marginal revolution.

The marginalists focused less on supply and production than on the
pulsing demand of consumption. The protagonist was not the landowner or
the laborer, working his way through the farm, the factory or the firm;
it was the universal man in the market whose signature act was to
consume things. That’s how market man increased his utility: by
consuming something until he reached the point where consuming one more
increment of it gave him so little additional utility that he was better
off consuming something else. Of such microscopic calculations at the
periphery of our estate was the economy made.

Though the early marginalists helped transform economics from a
humanistic branch of the moral sciences into a technical discipline of
the social sciences, they were still able to command an audience and an
influence all too rare in contemporary economics. Jevons spent his
career as an independent scholar and professor in Manchester and London
worrying about his lack of readers, but William Gladstone invited him
over to discuss his work, and John Stuart Mill praised it on the floor
of Parliament. Keynes tells us that “for a period of half a century,
practically all elementary students both of Logic and of Political
Economy in Great Britain and also in India and the Dominions were
brought up on Jevons.”

According to Hayek, the “immediate reception” of Menger’s *Principles*
“can hardly be called encouraging.” Reviewers seemed not to understand
it. Two students at the University of Vienna, however, did. One was
Friedrich von Wieser, the other Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, and both became
legendary educators and theoreticians. Their students included Hayek;
Ludwig von Mises, who attracted a small but devoted following in the
United States and elsewhere; and Joseph Schumpeter, dark poet of
capitalism’s forces of “creative destruction.” Through Böhm-Bawerk and
Wieser, Menger’s text became the groundwork of the Austrian school,
whose reach, due in part to the efforts of Mises and Hayek, now extends
across the globe.

The contributions of Jevons and Menger were multiple, yet each of them
took aim at a central postulate of economics shared by everyone from
Adam Smith to the socialist left: the notion that labor is a—if not
*the*—source of value. Though adumbrated in the idiom of prices and
exchange, the labor theory of value evinced an almost primitive faith in
the metaphysical objectivity of the economic sphere—a faith made all the
more surprising by the fact that the objectivity of the rest of the
social world (politics, religion and morals) had been subject to
increasing scrutiny since the Renaissance. Commodities may have come
wrapped in the pretty paper of the market, but inside, many believed,
were the brute facts of nature: raw materials from the earth and the
physical labor that turned those materials into goods. Because those
materials were made useful, hence valuable, only by labor, labor was the
source of value. That, and the fact that labor could be measured in some
way (usually time), lent the world of work a kind of ontological
status—and political authority—that had been increasingly denied to the
world of courts and kings, lands and lords, parishes and priests. As the
rest of the world melted into air, labor was crystallizing as the one
true solid.

By the time the marginalists came on the scene, the most politically
threatening version of the labor theory of value was associated with the
left. Though Marx would significantly revise and recast it in his mature
writings, the simple notion that labor produces value remained
associated with his name—and even more so with that of his competitor
Ferdinand Lasalle, about whom Nietzsche read a fair amount—as well as
with the larger socialist and trade union movements of which he was a
part. That association helped set the stage for the marginalists’
critique.

Admittedly, the relationship between marginalism and anti-socialism is
complex. On the one hand, there is little evidence to suggest that the
first-generation marginalists had heard of, much less read, Marx, at
least not at this early stage of their careers. Much more than the
threat of socialism underpinned the emergence of marginalist economics,
which was as opposed to traditional defenses of the market as it was to
the market’s critics. By the twentieth century, moreover, many
marginalists were on the left and used their ideas to help construct the
institutions of social democracy; even Walras and Alfred Marshall,
another early marginalist, were sympathetic to the claims of the left.
And on some readings, the mature Marx shares more with the
constructivist thrusts of marginalism than he does with the objectivism
of the labor theory of value.

On the other hand, Jevons was a tireless polemicist against trade
unions, which he identified as “the best example…of the evils and
disasters” attending the democratic age. Jevons saw marginalism as a
critical antidote to the labor movement and insisted that its teachings
be widely transmitted to the working classes. “To avoid such a
disaster,” he argued, “we must diffuse knowledge” to the
workers—empowered as they were by the vote and the strike—“and the kind
of knowledge required is mainly that comprehended in the science of
political economy.”

Menger interrupted his abstract reflections on value to make the point
that while it may “appear deplorable to a lover of mankind that
possession of capital or a piece of land often provides the owner a
higher income…than the income received by a laborer,” the “cause of this
is not immoral.” It was “simply that the satisfaction of more important
human needs depends upon the services of the given amount of capital or
piece of land than upon the services of the laborer.” Any attempt to get
around that truth, he warned, “would undoubtedly require a complete
transformation of our social order.”

Finally, there is no doubt that the marginalists of the Austrian school,
who would later prove so influential on the American right, saw their
project as primarily anti-Marxist and anti-socialist. “The most
momentous consequence of the theory,” declared Wieser in 1891, “is, I
take it, that it is false, with the socialists, to impute to labor alone
the entire productive return.”

With its division of intellectual labor, the modern academy often
separates economics from ethics and philosophy. Earlier economists and
philosophers did not make that separation. Even Nietzsche recognized
that economics rested on genuine moral and philosophical premises, many
of which he found dubious, and that it had tremendous moral and
political effects, all of which he detested. In *The Wanderer and His
Shadow*, Nietzsche criticized “our economists” for having “not yet
wearied of scenting a similar unity in the word ‘value’ and of searching
after the original root-concept of the word.” In his preliminary outline
for the summa he hoped to publish on “the will to power,” he scored the
“nihilistic consequences of the ways of thinking in politics and
economics.”

For that reason, Nietzsche saw in labor’s appearance more than an
economic theory of goods: he saw a terrible diminution of the good.
Morals must be “understood as the doctrine of the relations of
supremacy,” he wrote in *Beyond Good and Evil*; every morality “must be
forced to bow…before the order of rank.” But like so many before them,
including the Christian slave and the English utilitarian, the economist
and the socialist promoted an inferior human type—and an inferior set of
values—as the driving agent of the world. Nietzsche saw in this
elevation not only a transformation of values but also a loss of value
and, potentially, the elimination of value altogether. Conservatives
from Edmund Burke to Robert Bork have conflated the transformation of
values with the end of value. Nietzsche, on occasion, did too: “What
does nihilism mean?” he asked himself in 1887. “That the highest values
devaluate themselves.” The nihilism consuming Europe was best understood
as a democratic “hatred against the order of rank.”

Part of Nietzsche’s worry was philosophical: How was it possible in a
godless world, naturalistically conceived, to deem anything of value?
But his concern was also cultural and political. Because of democracy,
which was “Christianity made natural,” the aristocracy had lost “its
naturalness”—that is, the traditional vindication of its power. How then
might a hierarchy of excellence, aesthetic and political, re-establish
itself, defend itself against the mass—particularly a mass of
workers—and dominate that mass? As Nietzsche wrote in the late 1880s:

<div class="vspace">

</div>

<div class="indent">

A reverse movement is needed—the production of a synthetic, summarizing,
justifying man for whose existence this transformation of mankind into a
machine is a precondition, as a base on which he can invent his higher
form of being.\
He needs the opposition of the masses, of the “leveled,” a feeling of
distance from them. [He] stands on them, he lives off them. This higher
form of aristocracy is that of the future.—Morally speaking, this
overall machinery, this solidarity of all gears, represents a maximum of
exploitation of man; but it presupposes those on whose account this
exploitation has meaning.

</div>

Nietzsche’s response to that challenge was not to revert or resort to a
more objective notion of value: that was neither possible nor desirable.
Instead, he embraced one part of the modern understanding of value—its
fabricated nature—and turned it against its democratic and Smithian
premises. Value was indeed a human creation, Nietzsche acknowledged, and
as such could just as easily be conceived as a gift, an honorific
bestowed by one man upon another. “Through esteeming alone is there
value,” Nietzsche has Zarathustra declare; “to esteem is to create.”
Value was not made with coarse and clumsy hands; it was enacted with an
appraising gaze, a nod of the head signifying a matchless abundance of
taste. It was, in short, aristocratic.

While slaves had once created value in the form of Christianity, they
had achieved that feat not through their labor but through their censure
and praise. They had also done it unwittingly, acting upon a deep and
unconscious compulsion: a sense of inferiority, a rage against their
powerlessness, and a desire for revenge against their betters. That
combination of overt impotence and covert drive made them ill-suited to
creating values of excellence. Nietzsche explained in *Beyond Good and
Evil* that the self-conscious exercise and enjoyment of power made the
noble type a better candidate for the creation of values in the modern
world, for these were values that would have to break with the slave
morality that had dominated for millennia. Only insofar as “it knows
itself to be that which first accords honor to things” can the noble
type truly be “value-creating.”

Labor belonged to nature, which is not capable of generating value. Only
the man who arrayed himself against nature—the artist, the general, the
statesman—could claim that role. He alone had the necessary refinements,
wrought by “that *pathos of distance* which grows out of ingrained
difference between strata,” to appreciate and bestow value: upon men,
practices and beliefs. Value was not a product of the prole; it was an
imposition of peerless taste. In the words of *The Gay Science*:

<div class="vspace">

</div>

<div class="indent">

Whatever has *value* in our world now does not have value in itself,
according to its nature—nature is always value-less, but has been
*given* value at some time, as a present—and it was *we* who gave and
bestowed it.

</div>

That was in 1882. Just a decade earlier, Menger had written: “Value is
therefore nothing inherent in goods, no property of them, but merely the
importance that we first attribute to the satisfaction of our needs,
that is, to our lives and well-being.” Jevons’s position was identical,
and like Nietzsche, both Menger and Jevons thought value was instead a
high or low estimation put by a man upon the things of life. But lest
that desiring self be reduced to a simple creature of tabulated needs,
Menger and Jevons took care to distinguish their positions from
traditional theories of utility.

Jevons, for example, was prepared to follow Jeremy Bentham in his
definition of utility as “that property in an object, whereby it tends
to produce benefit, advantage, pleasure, good, or happiness.” He thought
this “perfectly expresses the meaning of the word Economy.” But he also
insisted on a critical rider: “provided that the will or inclination of
the person concerned is taken as the sole criterion, for the time, of
what is good and desirable.” Our expressed desires and aversions are not
measures of our objective or underlying good; there is no such thing.
Nor can we be assured that those desires or aversions will bring us
pleasure or pain. What we want or don’t want is merely a representation,
a snapshot of the motions of our will—that black box of preference and
partiality that so fascinated Nietzsche precisely because it seemed so
groundless and yet so generative. Every mind is inscrutable to itself:
we lack, said Jevons, “the means of measuring directly the feelings of
the human heart.” The inner life is inaccessible to our inspections; all
we can know are its effects, the will it powers and the actions it
propels. “The will is our pendulum,” declared Jevons, a representation
of forces that cannot be seen but whose effects are nevertheless felt,
“and its oscillations are minutely registered in all the price lists of
the markets.”

Menger thought the value of any good was connected to our needs, but he
was extraordinarily attuned to the complexity—and contingency—of that
relationship. Needs, wrote Menger, “at least as concerns their origin,
depend upon our wills or on our habits.” Needs are more than the givens
of our biology or psyche; they are the desideratum of our volitions and
practices, which are idiosyncratic and arbitrary. Only when our needs
finally “come into existence”—that is, only when we become aware of
them—can we truly say that “there is *no* *further arbitrary element*”
in the process of value formation.

Even then, needs must pass through a series of checkpoints before they
can enter the land of value. Awareness of a need, says Menger, entails a
comprehensive knowledge of how the need might be fulfilled by a
particular good, how that good might contribute to our lives, and how
(and whether) command of that good is necessary for the satisfaction of
that need. That last bit of knowledge requires us to look at the
external world: to ask how much of that good is available to us, to
consider how many sacrifices we must bear—how many satisfactions we are
willing to forgo—in order to secure it. Only when we have answered these
questions are we ready to speak of value, which Menger reminds us is
“the importance we attribute to the satisfaction of our needs.” Value is
thus “a judgment” that “economizing men make about the importance of the
goods at their disposal for the maintenance of their lives and
well-being.” It “does not exist outside the consciousness of men.” Even
though previous economists had insisted on the “objectification of the
value of goods,” Menger, like Jevons and Nietzsche, concludes that value
“is entirely subjective in nature.”

In their war against socialism, the philosophers of capital faced two
challenges. The first was that by the early twentieth century, socialism
had cornered the market on morality. As Mises complained in his 1932
preface to the second edition of *Socialism*, “Any advocate of
socialistic measures is looked upon as the friend of the Good, the
Noble, and the Moral, as a disinterested pioneer of necessary reforms,
in short, as a man who unselfishly serves his own people and all
humanity.” Indeed, with the help of kindred notions such as “social
justice,” socialism seemed to be the very definition of morality.
Nietzsche had long been wise to this insinuation; one source of his
discontent with religion was his sense that it had bequeathed to
modernity an understanding of what morality entailed (selflessness,
universality, equality) such that only socialism and democracy could be
said to fulfill it. But where Nietzsche’s response to the equation of
socialism and morality was to question the value of morality, at least
as it had been customarily understood, economists like Mises and Hayek
pursued a different path, one Nietzsche would never have dared to take:
they made the market the very expression of morality.

Moralists traditionally viewed the pursuit of money and goods as
negative or neutral; the Austrians claimed it embodies our deepest
values and commitments. “The provision of material goods,” declared
Mises, “serves not only those ends which are usually termed economic,
but also many other ends.” All of us have ends or ultimate purposes in
life: the cultivation of friendship, the contemplation of beauty, a
lover’s companionship. We enter the market for the sake of those ends.
Economic action thus “consists firstly in valuation of ends, and then in
the valuation of the means leading to these ends. All economic activity
depends, therefore, upon the existence of ends. Ends dominate economy
and alone give it meaning.” We simply cannot speak, writes Hayek in *The
Road to Serfdom*, of “purely economic ends separate from the other ends
of life.”

This claim, however, could just as easily be enlisted as an argument for
socialism. In providing men and women with the means of life—housing,
food, healthcare—the socialist state frees them to pursue the ends of
life: beauty, knowledge, wisdom. The Austrians went further, insisting
that the very decision about what constitutes means and ends was itself
a judgment of value. Any economic situation confronts us with the
necessity of choice, of having to deploy our limited resources—whether
time, money or effort—on behalf of some end. In making that choice, we
reveal which of our ends matters most to us: which is higher, which is
lower. “Every man who, in the course of economic activity, chooses
between the satisfaction of two needs, only one of which can be
satisfied, makes judgments of value,” says Mises.

For those choices to reveal our ends, our resources must be
finite—unlimited time, for example, would obviate the need for
choice—and our choice of ends unconstrained by external interference.
The best, indeed only, method for guaranteeing such a situation is if
money (or its equivalent in material goods) is the currency of
choice—and not just of economic choice, but of all of our choices. As
Hayek writes in *The Road to Serfdom*:

<div class="vspace">

</div>

<div class="indent">

So long as we can freely dispose over our income and all our
possessions, economic loss will always deprive us only of what we regard
as the least important of the desires we were able to satisfy. A
“merely” economic loss is thus one whose effect we can still make fall
on our less important needs…. Economic changes, in other words, usually
affect only the fringe, the “margin,” of our needs. There are many
things which are more important than anything which economic gains or
losses are likely to affect, which for us stand high above the amenities
and even above many of the necessities of life which are affected by the
economic ups and downs.

</div>

Should the government decide which of our needs are “merely economic,”
we would be deprived of the opportunity to decide whether these are
higher or lower goods, the marginal or mandatory items of our
flourishing. So vast is the gulf between each soul, so separate and
unequal are we, that it is impossible to assume anything universal about
the sources and conditions of human happiness, a point Nietzsche and
Jevons would have found congenial. The judgment of what constitutes a
means, what an end, must be left to the individual self. Hayek again:

<div class="vspace">

</div>

<div class="indent">

Economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which
can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all
our ends. And whoever has sole control of the means must also determine
which ends are to be served, which values are to be rated higher and
which lower—in short what men should believe and strive for.

</div>

While the economic is, in one sense readily acknowledged by Hayek, the
sphere of our lower needs, it is in another and altogether more
important sense the anvil upon which we forge our notion of what is
lower and higher in this world, our morality. “Economic values,” he
writes, “are less important to us than many things precisely because in
economic matters we are free to decide what to us is more, and what
less, important.” But we can be free to make those choices only if they
are left to us to make—and, paradoxically, if we are forced to make
them. If we didn’t have to choose, we’d never have to value anything.

<div class="vspace">

</div>

-   \* \*

By imposing this drama of choice, the economy becomes a theater of
self-disclosure, the stage upon which we discover and reveal our
ultimate ends. It is not in the casual chatter of a seminar or the
cloistered pews of a church that we determine our values; it is in the
duress—the ordeal—of our lived lives, those moments when we are not only
free to choose but forced to choose. “Freedom to order our own conduct
in the sphere where material circumstances force a choice upon us,”
Hayek wrote, “is the air in which alone moral sense grows and in which
moral values are daily re-created.”

While progressives often view this discourse of choice as either
dime-store morality or fabricated scarcity, the Austrians saw the
economy as the disciplining agent of all ethical action, a moment of—and
opportunity for—moral artistry. Freud thought the compressions of the
dream world made every man an artist; these other Austrians thought the
compulsions of the economy made every man a moralist. It is only when we
are navigating its narrow channels—where every decision to expend some
quantum of energy requires us to make a calculation about the
desirability of its posited end—that we are brought face to face with
ourselves and compelled to answer the questions: What do I believe? What
do I want in this world? From this life?

While there are precedents for this argument in Menger’s theory of value
(the fewer opportunities there are for the satisfaction of our needs,
Menger says, the more our choices will reveal which needs we value
most), its true and full dimensions can best be understood in relation
to Nietzsche. As much as Nietzsche railed against the repressive effect
of laws and morals on the highest types, he also appreciated how much
“on earth of freedom, subtlety, boldness, dance, and masterly sureness”
was owed to these constraints. Confronted with a set of social
strictures, the diverse and driving energies of the self were forced to
draw upon unknown and untapped reserves of ingenuity—either to overcome
these obstacles or to adapt to them with the minimum of sacrifice. The
results were novel, value-creating.

Nietzsche’s point was primarily aesthetic. Contrary to the romantic
notion of art being produced by a process of “letting go,” Nietzsche
insisted that the artist “strictly and subtly…obeys thousandfold laws.”
The language of invention—whether poetry, music or speech itself—is
bound by “the metrical compulsion of rhyme and rhythm.” Such laws are
capricious in their origin and tyrannical in their effect. That is the
point: from that unforgiving soil of power and whimsy rises the most
miraculous increase. Not just in the arts—Goethe, say, or Beethoven—but
in politics and ethics as well: Napoleon, Caesar, Nietzsche himself
(“Genuine philosophers…are commanders and legislators: they say, ‘thus
it shall be!’”).

One school would find expression for these ideas in fascism. Writers
like Ernst Jünger and Carl Schmitt imagined political artists of great
novelty and originality forcing their way through or past the filtering
constraints of everyday life. The leading legal theorist of the Third
Reich, Schmitt looked to those extraordinary instances in politics—war,
the “decision,” the “exception”—when “the power of real life,” as he put
it in *Political Theology*, “breaks through the crust of a mechanism
that has become torpid by repetition.” In that confrontation between
mechanism and real life, the man of exception would find or make his
moment: by taking an unauthorized decision, ordaining a new regime of
law, or founding a political order. In each case, something was “created
out of nothingness.”

It was the peculiar—and, in the long run, more significant—genius of the
Austrian school to look for these moments and experiences not in the
political realm but in the marketplace. Money in a capitalist economy,
Hayek came to realize, could best be understood and defended in
Nietzschean terms: as “the medium through which a force”—the self’s
“desire for power to achieve unspecified ends”—“makes itself felt.”

<div class="vspace">

The second challenge confronting the philosophers of capital was more
daunting. While Nietzsche’s transvaluation of values gave pride of place
to the highest types of humanity—values were a gift, the philosopher
their greatest source—the political implications of marginalism were
more ambidextrous. If on one reading it was the capitalist who gave
value to the worker, on another it was the worker—in his capacity as
consumer—who gave value to capital. Social democrats pursued the latter
argument with great zeal. The result was the welfare state, with its
emphasis on high wages and good benefits—as well as unionization—as the
driving agent of mass demand and economic prosperity. More than a
macroeconomic policy, social democracy (or liberalism, as it was called
in America) reflected an ethos of the citizen-worker-consumer as the
creator and center of the economy. Long after economists had retired the
labor theory of value, the welfare state remained lit by its afterglow.
The political economy of the welfare state may have been marginalist,
but its moral economy was workerist.

The midcentury right was in desperate need of a response that, squaring
Nietzsche’s circle, would clear a path for aristocratic action in the
capitalist marketplace. It needed not simply an alternative economics
but an answering vision of society. Schumpeter provided one, Hayek
another.

Schumpeter’s entrepreneur is one of the more enigmatic characters of
modern social theory. He is not inventive, heroic or charismatic. “There
is surely no trace of any mystic glamour about him,” Schumpeter writes
in *Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy*. His instincts and impulses are
confined to the office and the counting table. Outside those environs,
he cannot “say boo to a goose.” Yet it is this nothing, this great
inscrutable blank, that will “bend a nation to his will”—not unlike the
father figures of a Mann or Musil novel.

What the entrepreneur has—or, better, *is*—are force and will. As
Schumpeter explains in a 1927 essay, the entrepreneur possesses
“extraordinary physical and nervous energy.” That energy gives him focus
(the maniacal, almost brutal, ability to shut out what is inessential)
and stamina. In those late hours when lesser beings have “given way to a
state of exhaustion,” he retains his “full force and originality.” By
“originality,” Schumpeter means something peculiar: “receptivity to new
facts.” It is the entrepreneur’s ability to recognize that sweet spot of
novelty and occasion (an untried technology, a new method of production,
a different way to market or distribute a product) that enables him to
revolutionize the way business gets done. Part opportunist, part
fanatic, he is “a leading man,” Schumpeter suggests in *Capitalism,
Socialism and Democracy*, overcoming all resistance in order to create
the new modes and orders of everyday life.

Schumpeter is careful to distinguish entrepreneurialism from politics as
it is conventionally understood: the entrepreneur’s power “does not
readily expand…into the leadership of nations”; “he wants to be left
alone and to leave politics alone.” Even so, the entrepreneur is best
understood as neither an escape from nor an evasion of politics but as
its sublimation, the relocation of politics in the economic sphere.

Rejecting the static models of other economists—equilibrium is death, he
says—Schumpeter depicts the economy as a dramatic confrontation between
rising and falling empires (firms). Like Machiavelli in *The Prince*,
whose vision Nietzsche described as “perfection in politics,” Schumpeter
identifies two types of agents struggling for position and permanence
amid great flux: one is dynastic and lawful, the other upstart and
intelligent. Both are engaged in a death dance, with the former in the
potentially weaker position unless it can innovate and break with
routine.

Schumpeter often resorts to political and military metaphors to describe
this dance. Production is “a history of revolutions.” Competitors
“command” and wield ”pieces of armor.” Competition “strikes” at the
“foundations” and “very lives” of firms; entrepreneurs in equilibrium
“find themselves in much the same situations as generals would in a
society perfectly sure of permanent peace.” In the same way that Schmitt
imagines peace as the end of politics, Schumpeter sees equilibrium as
the end of economics.

Against this backdrop of dramatic, even lethal, contest, the
entrepreneur emerges as a legislator of values and new ways of being.
The entrepreneur demonstrates a penchant for breaking with “the routine
tasks which everybody understands.” He overcomes the multiple
resistances of his world—“from simple refusal either to finance or to
buy a new thing, to physical attack on the man who tries to produce it.”

<div class="vspace">

</div>

<div class="indent">

To act with confidence beyond the range of familiar beacons and to
overcome that resistance requires aptitudes that are present in only a
small fraction of the population and that define the entrepreneurial
type.

</div>

The entrepreneur, in other words, is a founder. As Schumpeter describes
him in *The Theory of Economic Development*:

<div class="vspace">

</div>

<div class="indent">

There is the dream and the will to found a private kingdom, usually,
though not necessarily, also a dynasty. The modern world really does not
know any such positions, but what may be attained by industrial and
commercial success is still the nearest approach to medieval lordship
possible to modern man.

</div>

That may be why his inner life is so reminiscent of the Machiavellian
prince, that other virtuoso of novelty. All of his energy and will, the
entirety of his force and being, is focused outward, on the enterprise
of creating a new order.

And yet even as he sketched the broad outline of this legislator of
value, Schumpeter sensed that his days were numbered. Innovation was
increasingly the work of departments, committees and specialists. The
modern corporation “socializes the bourgeois mind.” In the same way that
modern regiments had destroyed the “very personal affair” of medieval
battle, so did the corporation eliminate the need for “individual
leadership acting by virtue of personal force and personal
responsibility for success.” The “romance of earlier commercial
adventure” was “rapidly wearing away.” With the entrepreneurial function
in terminal decline, Schumpeter’s experiment in economics as great
politics seemed to be approaching an end.

<div class="vspace">

</div>

-   \* \*

Hayek offered an alternative account of the market as the proving ground
of aristocratic action. Schumpeter had already hinted at it in a stray
passage in *Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy*. Taking aim at the
notion of a rational chooser who knows what he wants, wants what is best
(for him, at any rate) and works efficiently to get it, Schumpeter
invoked a half-century of social thought—Le Bon, Pareto and Freud—to
emphasize not only “the importance of the extra-rational and irrational
element in our behavior,” but also the power of capital to shape the
preferences of the consumer.

Consumers do not quite live up to the idea that the economic textbooks
used to convey. On the one hand, their wants are nothing like as
definite, and their actions upon those wants nothing like as rational
and prompt. On the other hand, they are so amenable to the influence of
advertising and other methods of persuasion that producers often seem to
dictate to them instead of being directed by them.

In *The Constitution of Liberty*, Hayek developed this notion into a
full-blown theory of the wealthy and the well-born as an avant-garde of
taste, as makers of new horizons of value from which the rest of
humanity took its bearings. Instead of the market of consumers dictating
the actions of capital, it would be capital that would determine the
market of consumption—and beyond that, the deepest beliefs and
aspirations of a people.

The distinction that Hayek draws between mass and elite has not received
much attention from his critics or his defenders, bewildered or beguiled
as they are by his repeated invocations of liberty. Yet a careful
reading of Hayek’s argument reveals that liberty for him is neither the
highest good nor an intrinsic good. It is a contingent and instrumental
good (a consequence of our ignorance and the condition of our progress),
the purpose of which is to make possible the emergence of a heroic
legislator of value.

Civilization and progress, Hayek argues, depend upon each of us
deploying knowledge that is available for our use yet inaccessible to
our reason. The computer on which I am typing is a repository of
centuries of mathematics, science and engineering. I know how to use it,
but I don’t understand it. Most of our knowledge is like that: we know
the “how” of things—how to turn on the computer, how to call up our
word-processing program and type—without knowing the “that” of things:
that electricity is the flow of electrons, that circuits operate through
binary choices and so on. Others possess the latter kind of knowledge;
not us. That combination of our know-how and their knowledge advances
the cause of civilization. Because they have thought through how a
computer can be optimally designed, we are free to ignore its
transistors and microchips; instead, we can order clothes online, keep
up with old friends as if they lived next door, and dive into previously
inaccessible libraries and archives in order to produce a novel account
of the Crimean War.

We can never know what serendipity of knowledge and know-how will
produce the best results, which union of genius and basic ignorance will
yield the greatest advance. For that reason, individuals—all
individuals—must be free to pursue their ends, to exploit the wisdom of
others for their own purposes. Allowing for the uncertainties of
progress is the greatest guarantor of progress. Hayek’s argument for
freedom rests less on what we know or want to know than on what we don’t
know, less on what we are morally entitled to as individuals than on the
beneficial consequences of individual freedom for society as a whole.

In fact, Hayek continues, it is not really my freedom that I should be
concerned about; nor is it the freedom of my friends and neighbors. It
is the freedom of that unknown and untapped figure of invention to whose
imagination and ingenuity my friends and I will later owe our greater
happiness and flourishing: “What is important is not what freedom I
personally would like to exercise but what freedom some person may need
in order to do things beneficial to society. This freedom we can assure
to the unknown person only by giving it to all.”

Deep inside Hayek’s understanding of freedom, then, is the notion that
the freedom of some is worth more than the freedom of others: “The
freedom that will be used by only one man in a million may be more
important to society and more beneficial to the majority than any
freedom that we all use.” Hayek cites approvingly this statement of a
nineteenth-century philosopher: “It may be of extreme importance that
some should enjoy liberty…although such liberty may be neither possible
nor desirable for the great majority.” That we don’t grant freedom only
to that individual is due solely to the happenstance of our ignorance:
we cannot know in advance who he might be. “If there were omniscient
men, if we could know not only all that affects the attainment of our
present wishes but also our future wants and desires, there would be
little case for liberty.”

<div class="vspace">

</div>

-   \* \*

As this reference to “future wants and desires” suggests, Hayek has much
more in mind than producers responding to a pre-existing market of
demand; he’s talking about men who create new markets—and not just of
wants or desires, but of basic tastes and beliefs. The freedom Hayek
cares most about is the freedom of those legislators of value who shape
and determine our ends.

The overwhelming majority of men and women, Hayek says, are simply not
capable of breaking with settled patterns of thought and practice; given
a choice, they would never opt for anything new, never do anything
better than what they do now.

Action by collective agreement is limited to instances where previous
efforts have already created a common view, where opinion about what is
desirable has become settled, and where the problem is that of choosing
between possibilities already generally recognized, not that of
discovering new possibilities.

While some might claim that Hayek’s argument here is driven less by a
dim view of ordinary men and women than his dyspepsia about politics, he
explicitly excludes “the decision of some governing elite” from the acid
baths of his skepticism. Nor does he hide his misgivings about the
individual abilities of wage laborers who comprise the great majority.
The working stiff is a being of limited horizons. Unlike the employer or
the “independent,” both of whom are dedicated to “shaping and reshaping
a plan of life,” the worker’s orientation is “largely a matter of
fitting himself into a given framework.” He lacks responsibility,
initiative, curiosity and ambition. Though some of this is by
necessity—the workplace does not countenance “actions which cannot be
prescribed or which are not conventional”—Hayek insists that this is
“not only the actual but the preferred position of the majority of the
population.” The great majority enjoy submitting to the workplace regime
because it “gives them what they mainly want: an assured fixed income
available for current expenditure, more or less automatic raises, and
provision for old age. They are thus relieved of some of the
responsibilities of economic life.” Simply put, these are people for
whom taking orders from a superior is not only a welcome relief but a
prerequisite of their fulfillment: “To do the bidding of others is for
the employed the condition of achieving his purpose.”

It thus should come as no surprise that Hayek believes in an avant-garde
of tastemakers, whose power and position give them a vantage from which
they can not only see beyond the existing horizon but also catch a
glimpse of new ones:

<div class="vspace">

</div>

<div class="indent">

Only from an advanced position does the next range of desires and
possibilities become visible, so that the selection of new goals and the
effort toward their achievement will begin long before the majority can
strive for them.

</div>

These horizons include everything from “what we regard as good or
beautiful,” to the ambitions, goals and ends we pursue in our everyday
lives, to “the propagation of new ideas in politics, morals, and
religion.” On all of these fronts, it is the avant-garde that leads the
way and sets our parameters.

More interesting is how explicit and insistent Hayek is about linking
the legislation of new values to the possession of vast amounts of
wealth and capital, even—or especially—wealth that has been inherited.
Often, says Hayek, it is only the very rich who can afford new products
or tastes. Lavishing money on these boutique items, they give producers
the opportunity to experiment with better designs and more efficient
methods of production. Thanks to their patronage, producers will find
cheaper ways of making and delivering these products—cheap enough, that
is, for the majority to enjoy them. What was before a luxury of the idle
rich—stockings, automobiles, piano lessons, the university—is now an
item of mass consumption.

The most important contribution of great wealth, however, is that it
frees its possessor from the pursuit of money so that he can pursue
nonmaterial goals. Liberated from the workplace and the rat race, the
“idle rich”—a phrase Hayek seeks to reclaim as a positive good—can
devote themselves to patronizing the arts, subsidizing worthy causes
like abolition or penal reform, founding new philanthropies and cultural
institutions. Those born to wealth are especially important: not only
are they the beneficiaries of the higher culture and nobler values that
have been transmitted across the generations—Hayek insists that we will
get a better elite if we allow parents to pass their fortunes on to
their children; requiring a ruling class to start fresh with every
generation is a recipe for stagnation, for having to reinvent the
wheel—but they are immune to the petty lure of money. “The grosser
pleasures in which the newly rich often indulge have usually no
attraction for those who have inherited wealth.” (How Hayek reconciles
this position with the agnosticism about value he expresses in *The Road
to Serfdom* remains unclear.)

The men of capital, in other words, are best understood not as economic
magnates but as cultural legislators: “However important the independent
owner of property may be for the economic order of a free society, his
importance is perhaps even greater in the fields of thought and opinion,
of tastes and beliefs.” While this seems to be a universal truth for
Hayek, it is especially true in societies where wage labor is the rule.
The dominance of paid employment has terrible consequences for the
imagination, which are most acutely felt by the producers of that
imagination: “There is something seriously lacking in a society in which
all the intellectual, moral, and artistic leaders belong to the employed
classes…. Yet we are moving everywhere toward such a position.”

When labor becomes the norm, in both senses of the term, culture doesn’t
stand a chance.

In a virtuoso analysis of what he calls “The Intransigent Right,” the
British historian Perry Anderson identifies four figures of the
twentieth-century conservative canon: Schmitt, Hayek, Michael Oakeshott
and Leo Strauss. Strauss and Schmitt come off best (the sharpest, most
profound and far-seeing), Oakeshott the worst, and Hayek somewhere in
between. This hierarchy of judgment is not completely surprising.
Anderson has never taken seriously the political theory produced by a
nation of shopkeepers, so the receptivity of the English to Oakeshott
and Hayek, who became a British subject in 1938, renders them almost
irresistible targets for his critique. Anderson’s cosmopolitan
indifference to the indiscreet charms of the Anglo bourgeoisie usually
makes him the most sure-footed of guides, but in Hayek’s case it has led
him astray. Like many on the left, Anderson is so taken with the bravura
and brutality of Strauss’s and Schmitt’s self-styled realism that he
can’t grasp the far greater daring and profundity of Hayek’s political
theory of shopkeeping—his effort to locate great politics in the
economic relations of capitalism.

What distinguishes the theoretical men of the right from their
counterparts on the left, Anderson writes, is that their voices were
“heard in the chancelleries.” Yet whose voice has been more listened to,
across decades and continents, than Hayek’s? Schmitt and Strauss have
attracted readers from all points of the political spectrum as writers
of dazzling if disturbing genius, but the two projects with which they
are most associated—European fascism and American neoconservatism—have
never generated the global traction or gathering energy that
neoliberalism has now sustained for more than four decades.

It would be a mistake to draw too sharp a line between the marginal
children of Nietzsche—with political man on one branch of the family
tree, economic man on the other. Hayek, at times, could sound the most
Schmittian notes. At the height of Augusto Pinochet’s power in Chile,
Hayek told a Chilean interviewer that when any “government is in a
situation of rupture, and there are no recognized rules, rules have to
be created.” The sort of situation he had in mind was not anarchy or
civil war but Allende-style social democracy, where the government
pursues “the mirage of social justice” through administrative and
increasingly discretionary means. Even in *The Constitution of Liberty*,
an extended paean to the notion of a “spontaneous order” that slowly
evolves over time, we get a brief glimpse of “the lawgiver” whose “task”
it is “to create conditions in which an orderly arrangement can
establish and ever renew itself.” (“Of the modern German writings” on
the rule of law, Hayek also says, Schmitt’s “are still among the most
learned and perceptive.”) Current events seemed to supply Hayek with an
endless parade of candidates. Two years after its publication in 1960,
he sent *The Constitution of Liberty* to Portuguese strongman António
Salazar, with a cover note professing his hope that it might assist the
dictator “in his endeavour to design a constitution which is proof
against the abuses of democracy.” Pinochet’s Constitution of 1980 is
named after the 1960 text.

Still, it’s difficult to escape the conclusion that though Nietzschean
politics may have fought the battles, Nietzschean economics won the war.
Is there any better reminder of that victory than the
Detlev-Rohwedder-Haus in Berlin? Built to house the Luftwaffe during
World War II, it is now the headquarters of the German Ministry of
Finance.

urgent threats to the environment and democracy.*

Summary: In the last half-century of American politics, conservatism has
hardened around the defense of economic privilege and rule. Whether it’s
the libertarianism of the GOP or the neoliberalism of the Democrats,
that defense has enabled an upward redistribution of rights and a
downward redistribution of duties. Tags: conservatism, libertarianism,

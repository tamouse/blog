Making requests for what you want
---------------------------------

<span id="excerpt"></span> In order to get the things you want, often
you have to request things of someone. This can also be used for
self-directed actions, i.e., you are making requests of yourself. <span
id="excerptend"></span>

**Presupposition:** both parties are willing to negotiate to a
consensus.

**Presupposition:** the intention of both parties is to produce
(realize) the outcome.

**Presupposition:** all behavior is the result of an initial good
intention from the point of view of actor.

An **outcome** is often divided into two parts: a **request** and a
**commitment** are two halves of a whole **Conversation For Action** (a
concept put forth by Terry Winograd of Stanford University). The purpose
of the conversation is to have a person make a request of another
person, the second person commit (or promise) to fulfill the request.

-   a **request** is in the form of a question
-   a **commitment** is in the form of an assertion

1.  "I accept."
2.  "I decline."
3.  A counteroffer to negotiate the specifications of *X*, *Y*, and *T*.
    "I can't do *X* but I can do *X'*, by date *T'*. Is that ok?"
4.  A commitment to a future commitment ("I can't tell you now, but I'll
    get back to you about it on *date*."

All requests require a response; there is no such thing as silence
equals agreement. The opposite is the case: if no response is made, the
requestor should consider the request declined.

The [well-formedness of the outcome / request /
commitment](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Consulting.WellFormedOutcomes?action=print)
is the result of the full and independent commitment of both parties
agreeing to and having, or being able to aquire, the resources, skills
and knowledge to achieve the outcome / request / commitment. Each party
is completely and independently responsible for the
[well-formedness](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Consulting.WellFormedOutcomes?action=print)
of the outcome / request / commitment.

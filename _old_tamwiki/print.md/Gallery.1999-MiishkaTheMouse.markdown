<span id="excerpt"></span> Miiishka was a beloved member of my family
and my personal companion during long computing sessions. She was born
early in March, 99, and came home near the middle of April '99. Miiishka
was an English mouse, with black nose and face patches, and black
patches on her little butt. <span id="excerptend"></span>

Early in the fall, Miiishka started scratching her ear badly; I didn't
know what it was, but it went away after a few days. Then she started
doing it again this past January, and I came home from a 5-day trip to
find her with a horribly torn ear and open sores on her back. She was
not well-taken care of while I was gone. I treated her as best I could;
the vet could do nothing for her.

Finally, on February 17, 2000, I came home from work to find her still
and lifeless form. I buried her behind my patio, under a tree.

I wonder what, where, when and who she will return as......

I love you Miiishka, and miss you.....

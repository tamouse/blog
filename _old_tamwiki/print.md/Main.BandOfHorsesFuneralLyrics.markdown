------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Im coming up only\
to hold you under\
Im coming up only\
to show you wrong\
and to know you\
is hard we wander\
to know you all wrong\
we won\
Ooooohh oooohh\
Ooooohhhoohhhhooh\
Really to late to\
call so be waiting for\
morning to wake you\
is hard begun\
to know me as hard\
be goin' mad\
is to know me all wrong\
(be mud)\
and every occasion\
ill be ready for the funeral\
every occasion once more\
its called the funeral\
every occasion\
of im ready for the funeral\
and every occastion\
of one billion day funeral\
im coming up only\
to show you down fled\
im coming up only\
to show you wrong\
to the outside of the debby\
the analouge\
for days and countries\
hang there long\
(not sure if part right)\
Oooohhhohhhhhh\
Oooooohooooooh\
and every occasion\
ill be ready for the funeral\
and every occasion once more\
its called the funeral\
and every occasion\
of im ready for the funeral\
every occasion\
of one billion day funeral

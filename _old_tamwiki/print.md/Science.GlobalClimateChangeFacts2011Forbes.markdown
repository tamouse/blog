For readers of Forbes, the debate over climate change often takes the
form of "tit-for-tat" blogs, conflicting commentary, and dogmatic
ideological statements. Lost in this verbal debate are often the simple
facts and data of climate change and the immense and definitive global
observations of the ways in which our climate is actually changing
around us.

So, without much commentary, here are just a few simple and clear
pictures (and links) showing how the planet continued to warm and change
around us in 2011. And these facts are just part of why all national
academies of science on the planet and every major geophysical
scientific society agree that humans are fundamentally changing the
climate.

know that steaming is better; this recipe, however, takes sprouts out of
the ordinary veggie accompaniment and into a whole new territory.

Using sesame oil instead of olive oil (using a lot less!) gives these a

This dish goes great alongside <span

Instead of using a casserole dish, line a 9x13 inch baking pan with foil
and spread the sprout mixture over about 2/3rds of the pan and bake at
350 for 20 minutes or so (enough time to get the chicken ready), then
arrange the chicken in the other 1/3rd and lower the temp to 350 and
bake an additional 30 minutes.

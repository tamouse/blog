Introduction
------------

I have loved watercolour painting my entire life, but haven't done it
seriously (as in, taken classes, applied myself to learning, etc.) until
a few years ago.

I have a great teacher, who is funny, gentle, interested, and really a
lot of fun. She has taught me a lot.

Most of my artwork is sitting over on my
[DevianArt](http://muridaee.deviantart.com/gallery/) web site, but I've
decided to start posting here as I don't really like the DA interface
too much.

BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE EAR-LIDS

<span id="excerpt"></span> Patricia Goldman, as vice chairperson of the
National Transportation Safety Board, used to tell a story about how
poorly airline passengers listen. She says that one flight attendant,
who was frustrated by passenger inattentiveness during her
what-to-do-in-an-emergency talk, changed the wording. This is what she
actually said:

"When the mask drops down in front of you, place it over your naval and
continue to breathe normally."

Not a single passenger noticed. <span id="excerptend"></span>

We have eyelids, but we do not have ear-lids. To compensate, we learn to
listen selectively -- to turn our listening on and off. But if you have
ever been listened to, really listened to, you know how powerful that
experience is. You can likewise listen more effectively to others by
applying these four important listening principles.

<div class="vspace">

</div>

-   Listen with your eyes. Make eye contact with the speaker. Learn to
    concentrate on the moment at hand and clear your mind of
    distractions.

    </div>

-   Listen with your ears. It is impossible to listen when you are
    speaking.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

-   Listen with your mind. Let go of preconceived ideas about what you
    THINK the speaker is saying. Keep your mind open, even if you
    suspect you will dislike what you are about to hear.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

-   Listen with your heart. Be concerned for and genuinely interested in
    the person to whom you are listening. That will speak louder than
    anything you actually say.

Listening with your eyes, your ears, your mind and your heart is not
only effective, it will create an almost magical bond between you and
others that can be achieved in no other way. Dr. Karl Menninger stated:

<div class="round lrindent quote">

"Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The
friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are
listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand."

</div>

We all need a friend who really listens. And we can all be one.

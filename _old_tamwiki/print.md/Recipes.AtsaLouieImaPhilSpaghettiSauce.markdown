This is a recipe from the Palermo Brothers, a comedy duo, who had the
famous tag line "'Atsa Louie, I'ma Phil". This appeared in their
autobiography of that name. I am pretty sure it's out of print now, but
you can pick up facsimiles still. This recipe appeared in the paper,
which is how I got it. It's a winner!

5.  Add the spaghetti noodles to the boiling water and cook for about 20
    minutes. Check on this often as you don't want to (a) run out of
    water, (b) overcook the spaghetti.

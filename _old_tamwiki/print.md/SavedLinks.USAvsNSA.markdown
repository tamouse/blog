Welp looks like I'm going to have to do it, be back in like an hour or
two.

-   Update: Pulling in an old model I did for a game a while back.
    Retrofitting it to work with the scene.
-   Update2: Usa logo
-   Update3: The camera + Stand
-   Update4: Rigging all done, now for the time consuming part
    animation!
-   Update5: About a third the way through all the keyframes, and looks
    like I am going to pull a backup. Not to worry, I got this.(Thanks
    for Gold, :D)
-   Update6: Back in business, looks like we didn't lose much at all. :)
-   Update7: Ate some homemade pizza. { Don't hate me, :P } But the good
    news is I was able to render a small rough draft preview for you
    while I ate. Keep in mind there is still a bit left to do, the
    timing such will be sorted out and fixed. I will keep at it until
    it's perfect.
-   Update8: Getting closer, done with the keyframing and new materials.
    Soon it will be rendering time!
-   Update9: Here we go final render time, grab a beer(assuming you're
    of age) and sit back we're in the home stretch. [This will take some
    time]
-   Ughdate10: Render is being all slow. :/ I did set the samples a bit
    high, so it may take a little longer but it will look nicer. Right
    now its running at 27 seconds a frame, and it's more than halfway
    now.
-   Update11: So close now, 60 more frames and I got it down to 18
    seconds a frame. If you want something for the meantime I have a
    video on my(Unfinished) website, it has some behind the scenes stuff
    for animations like this. It's all I can do ATM, like watching paint
    dry. :)
-   Update12: It's here! and the Gif
-   Update13: Thanks everyone for all the amazing feedback, wouldn't
    have been able to keep going and pushing for it to be better if it
    wasn't for you. Here is a new alternate version a few have
    requested. Alternate Gif.

<span id="excerpt"></span> I had asked our teacher to go over some ink
and wash techniques with us. Instead she showed us outlining as a means
to "rescue" a painting we weren't happy with. I read about this
technique in an issue of Watercolour magazine last year, but it wasn't
really what I wanted to work on, so I struck off on my own. <span

The source image came from an old calendar. It has lots of spectral
qualities, which is probably the main attraction of the image as a
photograph. I was struck more by the structural elements of the bridge,
the skyline against the horizon, and the diagonal parking area.

Ink Drawing

I was initially pretty pleased with how the inking turned out. I used a
Sharpie writing pen, rather than my usual Sharpie markers. The ink was
drying out with the near constant use on the very absorbant watercolour
paper, so it's not nearly as I'd have liked it. Still I do like the way
things look at this point.

Reflections

I'm hoping I can manipulate the bridge deck to return some perspective
to it and make it actually look like it's moving into the picture.

Don't know where I found this recipe, but it makes a great dip. Someone
tried on their burger at a BBQ and declared it wonderful.

<span id="ingredients"></span>

Ingredients
-----------

-   1/2 pound of bacon
-   1 large onion, chopped (vidalia or walla-walla are best in this)
-   3 large cloves garlic, minced
-   1.5 cups light mayo or miracle whip
-   8 ounces of crumbled blue cheese
-   Ground black pepper to taste

<span id="directions"></span>

Directions
----------

1.  In a medium hot skillet, cook the bacon. *(The easiest way I've
    found to do this is cut up the uncooked bacon into 2 inch strips and
    keep a good eye on it while it's cooking. Bacon is one of those
    things that can go from underdone to overdone in a moment. See
    [MakingBaconBits](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Recipes.MakingBaconBits?action=print))*

3.  Add the onion and garlic to the bacon grease in the skillet and cook
    until the onion is translucent (or see [first
    comment](#comment001)). Drain and transfer to a bowl.

Variations
----------

This is one of those recipes you have to play around with quantities to
get it to the consistency you'd like. More/less mayo, more/less blue
cheese, etc. More bacon? You bet! Less bacon? NO WAY!

I'm going to try this with carmelized onions sometime.

Comments
--------

<span id="comment001"></span> The recipe says to only cook the onions
and garlic until translucent. I think this recipe would be made awesomer
and awesomer if you took the onions all the way to carmelized. <span

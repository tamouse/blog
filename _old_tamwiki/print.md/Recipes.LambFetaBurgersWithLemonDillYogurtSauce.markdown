Makes 8 mini-burgers.

<span id="ingredients"></span>

Ingredients
-----------

-   1/2 pound lean ground lamb *(since ground lamb is **so** expensive,
    I opted to use very lean ground beef instead, and it turned out
    great!)*
-   1/2 red onion, finely diced
-   1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley, chopped
-   2 ounces crumbled feta cheese
-   3 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for pan *(I
    omitted the oil entirely for this recipe)*
-   3 garlic cloves, finely chopped, divided
-   Salt and pepper to taste
-   1/4 cup Greek yogurt
-   Juice and zest of 1/2 lemon
-   1/4 teaspoon dried dill
-   1 cup fresh spinach leaves
-   4 small pita rounds, halved

Directions
----------

1.  In a mixing bowl, combine lamb, onion, parsley, feta, 2 teaspoons
    olive oil, 2 garlic cloves, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon
    pepper. Very gently use hands to combine ingredients, being careful
    not to break the feta down. Form into 8 patties, about 2Â½ inches
    wide. Set patties on a clean plate.

2.  Lightly brush a grill pan, regular pan or grill with enough olive
    oil to lightly grease it. Cook burgers to desired doneness (medium
    rare would be 2 to 3 minutes on each side). Remove from heat.

    olive oil, lemon juice and zest, dill, salt and pepper to taste.

    half. Place burger in with the spinach and drizzle with the yogurt
    sauce. Serve immediately.

Wake-up, Brain ... it's Tuesday again! (long weekend ;-)\
 Brought to you by the Innovation Network\
\
 We had so many great responses to the request for questions to
stimulate\
 creativity that we're going to send them in batches.  Here's the first\

 I don't have five.  I have 2 which work well for me.\
 1 If there were no time or money limitations what would you do?\
 2 When people tell me they don't know what to do, I ask\
 "If you knew what to do, what would it be?"\

 Two of my favorites:\
 1 What do you want that you don't have now?\
 2 What, if it were invented tomorrow, would put you out of business?\

 Starting from Kipling's What/When/Why/Where/Who/(How):\
 1 What have you done today that you have never done before?\
 2 When are you next going to do something different?\
 3 Why are you not doing or thinking something different '''right
now'''?\
 4 Where are you going on your holidays? (go somewhere '''different''')\
 5 Who have you helped think differently today?\
 6 How can you become even more creative?\
\
 (I know you said 5, but I decided to break the rule!)\

\
 \* These three questions, in their specific form only came to me late\
   in my 35 year engineering career in the Space business. How I wish\
   they had been trained into from early on, and continuously\
   thereafter.\
\
 1. Give me five different ways that this (device, item, item) can be
"broken".\
\
 Not only will one become more intimately acquainted with the "item"
than\
 they have ever been before, they will now be faced with the challenges
to\
 to exercise their "creativity" coming up with ways to re-design the
"item"\
 to keep it from being broken in ways they have never thought of
before.\
 (Note:  I only heard this challenge stated openly as I reached the end
of\
 my career in the Space business.  We, collectively were doing this,
though\
 not with the conscious intent of discovering ways to break an item.
 We\
 did test items extensively to see if they would perform within the\
 boundaries of a set of specifications as contrasted to looking for
ways\
 the item could be broken by 'surprise or the unexpected source".)\
\
 2  "Now that you have your (problem statement, mission statement, etc)\
 give me ten 'assumptions' implicit in the (problem statement, mission\
 statement, etc)."\
\
 3  Create a five or ten minute "lesson plan", and present it,  on how
you\
 would teach this concept to" a grade school class and a high school
class.\
 (Note: I have been asked this and I did it.  It was a memorable\
 experience. I profited greatly from this experience.)\

 1 How do YOU think we should do this?\
 2 What would make this work more fun AND faster?\
 3 If you had my job, what would you do differently?\
 4 How would YOU recommend we improve quality?\
 5 If this were "the last minute" would you do this assignment\
 differently?\

 I am really curious to see the answers.\
 My suggestions:\
 1 "In how many ways can we ....". The classic brainstorm question.\
 2 "This is a really difficult problem and I am sure many other\
 organizations have to deal with it. Can you address this problem?" In\
 this way you instantly rise above the case itself, suggesting looking
for\
 references, (improving on) proven methods, and a recognition that the\
 work to be done is not trivial.\
 3 "... Solve this problem. Forever." Now it's obvious somebody wants
this\
 solved very badly. And you give every freedom to do it.\

 Two of my favorite questions to get people thinking about thinking...\
 1 What's something you don't know?\
 2 What's a thought you've never thought before?\

 Tony Robbins poses some powerful questions which can help ignite\
 <span class="sc0">creativity<span class="sy0">:</span></span>\
 <span class="sc0">1 <span class="st0">"What is great about this
problem?"</span></span>\
 1 "How can I use this (situation, challenge etc) to improve ...?"\
\
 My favourite is:\
 1 "What would I do, if I knew I couldn't fail?"\
\

 Here are some questions I might ask my staff if I were trying to
inspire\
 them to be more creative:\
\
 \* What might we do that would create "buzz value" among our customers\
 and competitors?\
 \* How would Disney approach this challenge?\
 \* How many other ways could we think about this?\
 \* What might we do if money, time, and politics were no object?\
 \* How many ways can you think of to reframe the challenge?\
 \* What outcome would you be really proud of at the end of this\
 project?\
 \* What outcome might create an audible "WOW" in the organization?\

class="sy0">:</span> Vanda North <span class="sy0">\<</span><span
class="re2">VANDANORTH@NOSPAMcompuserve.com</span><span
class="sy0">\></span></span>\
 The questions I would ask are:\
 1 "What do you need to make  (X) it happen?"\
 2 "There are limitless resourses, now, what will you do?"\
 3 "If you were Leonardo da Vinci, how would you manage it?"\
 4 "They say this is impossible, and that we certainly can not do\
 it.................??!!"\
 5 "Go where-ever you relax best, and see what pops into your\
 mind?!"\

 In the introduction to my book, Bob Barlow's Book of Brain Boosters\
 (Scholastic), I thank my late father for posing the question that
sparked\
 my lifelong love of creativity. I was about five years old when he
looked\
 me in the eye and asked, "Bob, how do you throw away a garbage can?"\
\
 Dad wasn't looking for an answer, of course; there is no "right"
answer.\
 He just wanted to get me thinking -- which he did -- and that has made\
 all the difference. Bob Barlow, sixth grade teacher.\

class="sy0">:</span> Anne Robinson <span class="sy0">\<</span><span
class="re2">anniecreate@NOSPAMhotmail.com</span><span
class="sy0">\></span></span>\
 Five possible questions which would get me going.  Might\
 not others.\
 \* If you could make any change you want in your current situation or\
 assignment what would it be?\
 \* What setting would be most inspirational for you if you were asked\
 for a really creative idea?\
 \* How would you remove worry and fear of failure from your mind and\
 replace them with what William Miller calls "a flash of brillilance"?\
 \* How can you stretch your mind without leaving your brain hanging in\
 long gray loops?\
 \* What gift would you seek from seven specific geniuses to enhance\
 your own creative powers?\

class="sy0">\></span></span>\
 Here are some questions that have proved useful to me in the past (my\
 career was in Industrial Innovation).\
 1 How else might we solve this problem or take advantage of this\
 opportunity?\
 2 How else might we define the problem/opportunity we face?\
 3 How can we polish this "diamond in the rough"?\
 4 How would you describe the feelings of "aha" that you have\
 experienced?\
 5 Who else can help us with our problem?\
\
 <span class="sc0"><span class="kw3">From</span><span
class="sy0">:</span> Dale M. Parish <span class="sy0">\<</span><span
class="re2">IE\_DMP@nospamHAL.LAMAR.EDU</span><span
class="sy0">\></span></span>\
 1 What is it that '''I''' (manager) do that I can stop doing that
would\
 help you feel less restricted.\
 2 What is it about the work environment here that you believe keeps\
 people from offering their suggestions.\
 3 What can we do together to take the limits away for solving\
 this/these problem(s).\
 4 Whom in this department do you feel is the least receptive to change\
 that could be moved to a position where they could be happy in doing\
 non-creative work?\
 5 What structure can I create as department manager to make the others\
 in this department really believe that their most outlandish
suggestions\
 would be given a fair shake?\

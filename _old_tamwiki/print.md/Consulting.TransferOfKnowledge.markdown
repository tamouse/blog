Transfer of Knowledge
---------------------

The transfer of knowledge across time and space requires the same two
things that is required when the two exchangers (Teacher and Pupil) are
in the same place and time:

<div class="vspace">

</div>

-   The Pupil must listen, listen with all his awareness, must listen
    faster than the flow of information, to be able to perceive the
    knowledge behind it.
-   The Teacher must also listen, listen to the place within himself
    that the flow of knowledge comes from. The flow is ever changing, a
    torrent of information for the senses. The Teacher must listen to
    this torrent faster than the torrent is running.

Across space and time requires that both the Teacher and Pupil listen
without the senses at all -- the information from the torrent has
already passed (both of them) by the time the Teacher prepares the
lesson and the pupil receives it.

The Teacher must prepare the lesson for the Pupil out in the future, so
it will be appropriate for the Pupil at the time he receives it,
appropriate to the current situation, the flow of the stream of
knowledge and perception, and for the journey both of the them (Teacher
and Pupil) have made up to that point.

-   What does this imply for transferring knowledge about SWI, our
    system, our consultant-client system, our client systems, and our
    corporate system?
    -   one thought: we are currently at a stage of our enlightenment
        where we are gathering knowledge. We have gone through our
        purification ritual -- the SWI transformed from the "same old
        Corporate Engineering" into one of the most successful Corporate
        entities around -- our purification came from laying aside the
        old ways and means, and taking up a new set of core beliefs
        about ourselves and our clients.
-   Now we are on the second stage, the place where knowledge is
    revealed. We have been on this stage for some time. We need, as an
    organization to move on, to transform yet again, to the place beyond
    knowing, where we no longer have to manage the information stream,
    but can surf on it instead.

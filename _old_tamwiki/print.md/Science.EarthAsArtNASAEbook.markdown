In 1960, the United States put its first Earth-observing environmental
satellite into orbit around the planet. Over the decades, these
satellites have provided invaluable information, and the vantage point
of space has provided new perspectives on Earth. This book celebrates
Earth??s aesthetic beauty in the patterns, shapes, colors, and textures
of the land, oceans, ice, and atmosphere. The book features 75 stunning
images of Earth from the Terra, Landsat 5, Landsat 7, EO-1, and Aqua
satellites. Sensors on these satellites can measure light outside of the
visible range, so the images show more than what is visible to the naked
eye. The images are intended for viewing enjoyment rather than
scientific interpretation. The beauty of Earth is clear, and the
artistry ranges from the surreal to the sublime.

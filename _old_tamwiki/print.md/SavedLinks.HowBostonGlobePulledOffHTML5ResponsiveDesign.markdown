On Monday, The Boston Globe released its new premium content mobile
initiative dubbed <span class="wikiword">BostonGlobe</span>.com. That is
not to be confused with Boston.com, its free flagship website. This unto
itself is not all that interesting. Yet, the <span
class="wikiword">HTML5</span> development community is heaping praise on
<span class="wikiword">BostonGlobe</span>.com primarily for how the
sites renders across varying screen sizes, an innovation called
responsive design.

Responsive design allows the Globe's content to be refitted to any
screen size available automatically. It is a win in the fight against
mobile device fragmentation and screen sizes and the future of how
content is displayed on mobile devices. Below is an in-depth discussion

they faced along the way.

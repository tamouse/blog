Directions
----------

1.  Heat a heavy-bottomed, wide pan (one with tight-fitting lid that is
    just large enough to hold all four legs comfortably) over medium
    heat for a full minute.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

2.  Add the olive oil. The oil should streak and ripple subtly when the
    pan is hot enough to cook in.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

3.  Add the seasoned chicken legs to the hot pan, skin side down. There
    should be a moderate hiss when the meat hits the pan. Don't touch or
    move them for the first few minutes.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

4.  Brown the chicken legs on both sides, taking care not to tear the
    skin when turning ^[2](#fn1_2)^<span id="fnr1_2"></span>
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

5.  Remove the browned meat to a platter. Pour off any fat from the pan
    and discard. Return the pan to the burner and reduce heat to low.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

6.  Add the shallots to the pan and stir to prevent burning. Some of the
    brown bits from the pan will start to coat the shallots.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

7.  Add the cornichons and their brine and continue stirring, loosening
    all the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Adjust the heat so
    the liquid is simmering gently.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

8.  Arrange the chicken legs in one layer in the pan, pour in the
    vinegar, the stock, and the hard cider, and then gently stir in and
    around the legs to bring everything together: shallots, cornichons,
    and liquids. Season to taste.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

9.  Bring pan to a simmer, reduce heat and cover tightly. Allow to
    braise for aproximately 30 minutes.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

10. Remove the lid and check the chicken for doneness.
    ^[3](#fn1_3)^<span id="fnr1_3"></span> Recover and continue cooking
    an addition 10 minutes or so to get chicken to desired doneness.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

11. Transfer to chicken legs to plates.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

12. Stir in cubes of butter and stir until melted. Spoon sauce over
    chicken. Sprinkle with chopped parsley before serving.

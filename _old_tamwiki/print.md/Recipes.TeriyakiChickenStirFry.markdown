Stir-fries are easy and wonderful and you can experiment with all kinds
of things. At one point, I just picked up a bunch of fresh veggies and
went at it. This is the result. This recipe requires two separate pans,
one to cook the vegetables and other to cook the chicken.

Ingredients
-----------

-   4 carrots
-   1 small yellow squash
-   1 small zucchini

Directions
----------

(It usually works to prepare the vegetables before you start cooking.)

1.  peel and slice the onion into thin strips
2.  peel and julienne the carrots, about 2 inch pieces
3.  cut the squash and zucchini into dimes (you may want to split the
    wide ends so they remain bite-sized)
4.  quarter the eggplant and slice horizontally
5.  cube the chicken

    minutes, stirring occasionally
8.  add the squash, zucchini and eggplant

15. at the end of cooking, add the snow peas and stir them through the
    vegetables to cook them slightly (you don't want them to lose their
    crunch)
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

16. Combine the chicken and the vegetables

Variations
----------

One can do this with other vegetables, as well.

Additions I have done:

-   sliced mushrooms, go in with the squash and eggplant
-   bean sprouts, go in near the end
-   a touch of rice wine vinegar to the vegetables
-   additional spices: curry powder, cardamom, garlic powder, dry
    mustard, ground ginger, cayenne pepper, thai chili paste

Comments
--------

Chicken is one of those foods you can cook from frozen. While this may
be convenient so you don't have to remember to thaw out the chicken
pieces, it really works better if you can cube the chicken at the start
of the dish rather than having to cook it thawed to the point you can
cut it up. Thawed, cubed chicken cooks much more uniformly and takes on
the flavourings of the teriyaki sauce better, I've found, and it cooks a
lot faster as well.

[PmWiki](http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/PmWiki/PmWiki) is one of the best
wiki systems going. While nowhere near as popular as
[MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org) (which runs
[WikiPedia](http://wikipedia.org)), PmWiki has a whole lot of features
and a very active development and community. <span

PmWiki straight out of the box already does a lot, but there are also
scads of [recipes](http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/Cookbook/Index) one can
add to PmWiki to get it to do just about anything. Written in
[PHP](http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Technology.PHP?action=print), PmWiki
enjoys a robust and productive development community, and one can
consider it a good platform for a CMS and web site development, even if
the site is not intended to be collaborative, the traditional wiki
strength.

I have been using PmWiki for a number of years, coming to it after
trying several other wiki platforms. I have been developing recipes and
skins for it, as well as other extensions via markup.

[Social Problems in Teens Can Lead to Personality
Disorders](http://psychcentral.com/news/2011/09/29/social-problems-in-teens-can-lead-to-personality-disorders/29893.html)

A new research study looks at how adolescents think, how disordered
thinking can take root, and how this thought pattern can ultimately lead
to an adult personality disorder.

The study examines the relationship between borderline personality
disorder (BPD) traits and "hypermentalizing" in adolescents. Mentalizing
is the social intelligence that refers to the ability to infer and
attribute thoughts and feelings to understand and predict another
person's behavior.

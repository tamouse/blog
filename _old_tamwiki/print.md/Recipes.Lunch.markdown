<span id="excerpt"></span> Ah, lunch. The mid-day meal. Usually lighter
faire in these parts. In Minnesota, it's a common thing to visit someone
and hear "Would you like a little lunch?" It doesn't actually matter
what time of day it is, although between 8am and 6pm usually. Before 8am
it's breakfast, after 6pm it's supper (or dinner if you're uppity like
that). But, lunch. Sammiches. Picnic faire. And some other things as
well. <span id="excerptend"></span>

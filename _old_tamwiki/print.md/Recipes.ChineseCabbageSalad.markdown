There's very little about this recipe that is Chinese. The ramen is
japanese, for example. It calls for red wine vinegar instead of rice
vinegar as well. Broccoli slaw instead of shredded chinese cabbage.

I had another recipe for Chinese Chicken Salad that I hope to recreate
someday, but this looks pretty serviceable for now, just add some cooked
chicken to it.

I have not tried this recipe to be sure, but the vinegar:oil ratios seem
really off to me. I'd also use rice wine vinegar instead of red
wine+sugar for more authenticity. Also, instead of broccoli slaw
(although it sounds good) for more authenticity I'd use shredded Chinese
cabbage.

**Computerworld** - Building a website has never been easier. Gone --
mostly -- are the days of having to hand-code HTML and PHP scripts in
order to get a slick, fully functional website, thanks to the
capabilities of content management systems that do most or all of the
heavy lifting for site creators.

There are boatloads of content management systems (<span
class="wikiword">CMSs</span>) for serious site creators, but the most
common for websites today are three open-source tools: Joomla, Drupal
and <span class="wikiword">WordPress</span>. Actually, to call them
"tools" is an understatement -- these are full-fledged platforms, with
tens of thousands of add-on tools created by very active developer
communities.

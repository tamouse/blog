The Targum may have helped us out of the contradiction, but we still
have to understand: what advice is King Solomon giving us?

The first step is to define the term "ksil." There are numerous
descriptions of the ksil throughout Mishlei: "ksilim hate knowledge"
(1:22), "licentiousness is a sport for the ksil" (1o:23), "turning away
from evil is an abomination to the ksil" (13:19). In short, a **ksil is
a person who shuns the life of the mind and embraces the life of the
instincts and emotions.**

The key phrase here is "in accordance with his foolishness." The
fundamental principle of arguing with a ksil is to recognize that he is
a ksil. King Solomon warns us not to respond to the ksil in the same way
we would respond to someone who is ignorant or mistaken. The ksil's
problem runs so deep, that he requires an answer tailored to his
distorted personality.

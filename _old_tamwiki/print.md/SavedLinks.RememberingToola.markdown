The Monterey Bay Aquarium regrets to announce the passing of Toola, a
female Sea Otter who was arguably the most important animal in the
28-year history of the aquarium's pioneering Sea Otter Research and
Conservation program. Toola died early Saturday morning (March 3) in the
aquarium's veterinary care center, of natural causes and infirmities of
age.

She was the first rescued Sea Otter ever to raise pups that were
successfully returned to the wild; and was the inspiration for state
legislation that better protects Sea Otters.

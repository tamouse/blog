Finally, to the young girl I've seen only in my imagination, my someday
daughter:

I hope that by the time you grow up, things will have changed.

If they haven't, and you find yourself being treated poorly,
marginalized, objectified and idealized, infuriated, ignored, shoved
aside, held to a double standard, emotionally blackmailed, taunted and
insulted, overlooked and under-appreciated, your wishes dismissed, your
gender reduced to a vulgarity, slut-shamed and resented, I hope you will
still keep your head high and pursue your dreams.

After writing this post on somone hacking QR codes, Hack A Day
commenters came out in full force posting some really cool links about
modifying QR codes to include a logo. I'll fully admit I geeked out a
little, but in the process I figured out some of the theory behind
embedding logos in QR codes.

After getting my hands on the ISO 18004 specification for QR codes, I
decided to try embedding the Hack A Day skull & wrenches inside a QR
code. The tools I used were Photoshop, this QR code generator, and
Microsoft Paint (I've never seen a program to edit individual pixels
that has a better UI, so don't laugh).

For this how-to, I'm going to walk through the process of modifying a
Version 6 QR code. The Version 6 QR code is 41 pixels square, and is a
very good balance between the amount of data that can be presented and
the physical size of the code itself. The graphic below shows what is
absolutely required of a Version 6 QR code standard. In practice, what
is actually necessary is a little different, but I'll just go with the
specs for now.

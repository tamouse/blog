Trip to Thailand in December, 2001
----------------------------------

<span id="excerpt"></span> In 2001, I and a friend went to Thailand for
3 weeks. It was a most wonderful experience for me, having never been to
Asia. I fell in love with the country almost immediately, save for the
heat and humidity â€” and Winter is supposed to be their *coolest* month!

I used an HP Photosmart camera, which was a little point-and-shoot
digital camera, one of the first HP made. Sadly, on the flight home the
battery door got crunched and I couldn't fix it. :(

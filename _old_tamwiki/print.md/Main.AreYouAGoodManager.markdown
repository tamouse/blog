Are You a Good Manager?
-----------------------

What if you asked a million people 100 questions? For most of us we'd
pass out from data overload, but for the Gallup Organization, it was
like throwing Brer Rabbit into the briar patch. They were in their
element as they analyzed responses to 100 questions they asked one
million employees in search of a magic set of questions that would
correlate with employee and organizational performance.

They found 12 questions that fit the bill and those questions form part
of the foundation of, *First, Break All the Rules* by Marcus Buckingham
& Curt Coffman. These twelve questions, when answered 'strongly agree,'
identify high performance employees ... but, the hard part is creating
an environment where the employees can answer 'strongly agree.' This
turns out to be more of a management test than an employee assessment.

Try these questions out ... first on yourself, then on your employees.
To which questions would you answer 'strongly agree?'

1.  Do I know what is expected of me at work?
2.  Do I have the equipment and materials I need to do my work right?
3.  Do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?
4.  In the last 7 days, have I received recognition or praise for good
    work?
5.  Does my supervisor or someone at work seem to care about me as a
    person?
6.  Is there someone at work who encourages my development?
7.  Do my opinions seem to count?
8.  Does the mission or purpose of my company make me feel like my work
    is important?
9.  Are my co-workers committed to doing quality work?
10. Do I have a best friend at work?
11. In the last 6 months, have I talked with someone about my progress?
12. This last year, have I had opportunities at work to learn and grow?

If you ... and your employees ... did not answer 'strongly agree' to
every one of these questions, you might want to read the book. There is
also a sequel 'Now, Discover Your Strengths' and an online column on
managing strengths : <http://www.gallup.com/poll/managing/mr010212.asp>

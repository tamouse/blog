Reinventing Your Business
-------------------------

by Peter Flatow, President, Co-Knowledge

The fact is all true innovation is just the reinvention of something
that already exists. Companies or individuals that are successful
subscribe to a combination of the following reinvention principles.

</div>

-   Be proactive. Most managers and companies are reluctant to reinvent
    or renew what has worked in the past.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

-   Reinvent; don't repackage. Reinvention should not be confused with
    minor modifications of the status quo.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

-   Look beyond the present and familiar. What drives innovation is
    determining where the company needs to go, not where it is.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

-   Use reinvention to generate added value. There was a time when a
    good product was enough. But most companies could build a good
    product, so successful companies added a service component. Now
    product with service (or service with product) is not enough, you
    must add a solid experience component.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

-   Be willing to take some risk. A defining difference between
    new-economy companies and old-economy companies is not the dot.com
    but the willingness to reinvent something because they have no
    vested interest in the status quo. Chrysler built the first Mini-Van
    because they did not have a station wagon business.

I am so so so excited to share this recipe with you today. Yes, it’s
only 2 ingredients. And I mean really two ingredients. Not one of those
recipes that say two or three ingredients and then one of the
ingredients is something like “pre-made dough” or “cake mix.” (Not that
there is anything wrong with those recipes.)\
![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jzJEAHxchwY/T2wbW6hzNbI/AAAAAAABY90/f9guRRSGTxM/s800/flourless-nutella-cake-8.jpg)\
All you need is Nutella and eggs. That’s it. (Okay I guess technically
Nutella may be considered more than one ingredient since it’s a spread
with multiple things. But I don’t think of it the same as something like
cake mix as an ingredient.)\
![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WpyouPeKar0/T2wcRxKDRaI/AAAAAAABY_g/S7vRiVO1oE8/s800/flourless-nutella-cake-15.jpg)\
With only two ingredients, it’s so simple to make.

</div>

And the taste? The taste is divine. Rich, decadent. I didn’t think I
could make a cake with only two ingredients.  But it’s possible.\

I haven’t been this excited about a recipe since I made my [bacon fried
eggs](http://kirbiecravings.com/2011/03/fried-bacon-eggs.html) or my
[nutella lava
cookies](http://kirbiecravings.com/2011/06/nutella-lava-cookies.html). I
hope you love this as much as I do. It’s my new favorite recipe. The
batter takes less than 10 minutes to make. The cake bakes for 25
minutes. FH and I both loved this cake. It’s so good I already made it
twice this week! (You know, just to make sure the first one wasn’t a
fluke.)

For more Nutella recipes, you can check out my collection
[here](http://kirbiecravings.com/category/recipes/nutella-recipes).

Notes: So there’s been a lot of comments on this post and while many
people have made it successfully, there have been a few people who
complain their cake tastes “eggy” or it didn’t work. You have to follow
the recipe exactly and you have to make sure you whip the eggs enough
and use enough Nutella. With only 2 ingredients, it is easy to make but
if you try to simplify the steps, you likely will end up with a poor
result.

<div class="vspace">

</div>

-   The key to the texture of the cake and to not end up with something
    “eggy” is the whipped eggs which are whipped until triple the
    volume. This creates the cake texture and it should not end up just
    tasting like sweetened eggs because the eggs have so much air
    whipped into them. So it’s important to whip the eggs long enough
    with a stand mixer. I don’t know if a hand mixer is powerful enough.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

-   In addition, when you fold in the eggs and Nutella together, it
    needs to be done in small batches and not all at once or you risk
    deflating most of the egg meringue you’ve made.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

-   Finally, make sure to weigh out the Nutella, and make sure you get
    all that Nutella into the actual cake as I know it can be sticky and
    often people leave a lot of the Nutella behind in their measuring
    cup.

!! Two Ingredient Flourless Nutella cake**Prep Time:** 10 mins**Cook
Time:** 25 mins**Total Time:** 35 mins!!! Ingredients:4 large or extra
large eggs\
8 1/2 ounces Nutella (weigh this out on a scale)!!! Directions:1. Grease
a 6 or 7 inch round springform pan. Then line with parchment paper on
sides and on bottom. (One of the cakes I made, I simply sprayed pan but
it still sticks, so it is best to line with parchment paper. By spraying
with oil first, the parchment paper stick ons better.) Preheat oven to
350F. Beat eggs on highest speed with stand mixer until about triple in
volume, about 6 minutes. The egg consistency is the key to making this
recipe work, so don't try to save time on this step. Eggs must be beaten
until triple in volume as that is what creates the cake.\
2. Measure out Nutella into a glass bowl. Microwave Nutella for about 20
seconds to make it softer. Add in 1/3 of the egg mixture. Gently stir
with a spatula in the same clockwise direction until all of the egg is
mixed in and no streaks remain. Then add another 1/3 of egg mixture and
fold again until no egg streaks remain. Pour in remaining third and make
sure to scrape the foam that sticks to the mixing bowl into the batter
and stir until no streaks remain. Make sure to do this in 3 batches
because otherwise the whipped eggs may lose too much of the air that has
been whipped into them if you try to do it all at once.\
3. Pour batter into springfoam pan. Bake for 20-25 minutes until knife
inserted comes out clean. Let cake cool *completely* before removing
from pan and cutting and serving.

        replied: — March 23rd, 2012 @ 1:35 pmI think that should be
        okay. Though the cake is a little hard to remove, which is one
        of the reasons the springform pan is good. but I think if you
        can completely cover in parchment paper your round pan it should
        work.

    perhaps… Biscoff??

        replied: — March 29th, 2012 @ 3:10 pmA Biscoff version needs a
        little tweaking. i tried a biscoff version with the same
        measurements and it didn’t work. I’m going to fiddle with it
        some more after I get more Biscoff.

        replied: — June 27th, 2012 @ 8:04 amYou are supposed to soften
        the Nutella in the microwave so it shouldn’t be stiff when you
        mix it in. I’m thinking either you didn’t beat the eggs enough
        (perhaps your mixer isn’t strong enough or you need to turn it
        to a higher setting or beat longer?) which would cause it to
        collapse, or maybe you added too much Nutella. The Nutella needs
        to be weighed out on a scale. Also you want to make sure when
        you are mixing it that no streaks of egg remain. Hope this
        helps!

        replied: — June 28th, 2012 @ 12:15 amI think it would be really
        really hard, though not impossible. You have to whip them at a
        high speed with a mixer for quite a few minutes to achieve the
        volume, so it would be a lot of hard hand work. But I’ve seen
        videos of people in Japan hand beating the eggs for castella
        cake which requires a similar rise in volume.

        replied: — August 9th, 2012 @ 9:49 amUnfortunately, for this
        recipe the eggs are essential. Without the whipped eggs you

        applesauce or yogurt to substitute. I do have several easy egg
        free recipes you can try. Maybe this one?

        If it’s not the consistency (i.e., thicker, more oily, more

    pmHey](http://kirbiecravings.com:80/#comment-106658)! Glad I found
    this recipe. I’m having a dinner guest tomorrow night, and with all
    that I’m cooking, this will be a quick, easy dessert.Oh! also, I was
    reading some of the negative feedback, and I think I know why it
    might taste like an omelette. It is possible that aside from not
    whisking the eggs enough, perhaps too much of the egg was mixed in
    with the hot nutella, causing the eggs to cook prematurely. That
    would likely cause an omelette taste. Do you think maybe it would be
    a good idea to mix in a small amount of the warm nutella into the
    raw egg first to temper them, and then pour the tempered egg mixture
    into the the nutella, 1/3rd by 1/3rd? Just a thought.

        replied: — November 14th, 2012 @ 10:59 pmThe Nutella is only
        microwaved briefly, so I don’t think it gets nearly hot enough
        to cook the egg mixture. I think people who are ending up with
        the omelette taste are either not whisking the eggs enough, or
        not pouring enough Nutella. It needs to be weighed out and I
        think some people might just use a measuring cup and look at the
        oz measurement, or they don’t scrape enough of the Nutella out
        of the cup/bowl.\
        Anyway, I hope the recipe turns out well for you! I’ve made it
        half a dozen times with no problems and I know a lot of people
        who’ve made it just fine too.

    this and it’s pretty good! The texture is like a springy custard due
    to the egg, but the Nutella taste really shines through.I poured my
    mixture into one of those ready made pie crusts and it really
    compliments it I think. Thanks!

    1. I used an eight inch square glass pan\

        replied: — November 17th, 2012 @ 8:22 amThe process of making
        these is similar to a chiffon cake or macarons. You’re basically
        making a sort of meringue with the eggs. The whipped eggs is
        what gives the cake the texture. If you stir in opposite
        directions, it will mess up the meringue you’ve created from the
        whipped eggs and the cake could fall or not turn out right.

    looks the same as the one in the picture…\
    My husband and I liked the flavor, but as Erin (25), we agreed the
    flavor of the eggs are stronger than nutella’s. It tastes more like
    a pudding than like a cake. I don’t have a mixer, so I started with
    the blender and finished by hand (yes, I did)…it took almost half an
    hour…O\_O My husband told me my right arm is now bigger than the
    left one… =)\
    Besides the flavor of the eggs, I’ll try again…maybe we’ll add some
    more nutella.\

        transport these treats.

        turn out right. I’ve found user a stand mixer makes a difference
        compared to handheld mixer. Also it really is important that you
        whip enough air into the eggs, so that they are 3 times the
        volume. I’m not quite sure how it would taste if you separate
        the eggs yolks and egg whites. I would imagine it would be more
        souffle like.

    Joe’s cocoa almond spread to be thicker than nutella and since it
    contains some soy flour, I noticed the flavor of soy. But for those
    of you allergic to hazelnuts it would be an idea. T.J’s e-mailed me
    and said that it contains no gluten ingredients, not prepared on
    shared lines but in facility that has wheat. so for those of us
    gluten intolerant, it is a personal decision as to whether to use
    it. Whisking the egg yolks and white separately and then combining
    would probably give more of a meringue texture than a creamy texture
    from eggs holding the nutella together.

    amDid](http://kirbiecravings.com:80/#comment-131909) anyone try it,
    or everyone just write that it is delicious, before they actually
    tried it?\
    I did bake it, and it’s awful. I am sorry but it tastes of nothing
    but sweet eggs. Post factum I thought it through and it kind of
    makes sense – if you have 2 ingredients – chocolate and eggs, it
    can’t taste any different than of sweet eggs.\
    Try it if you want, but be warned! Cheers!

        replied: — December 6th, 2012 @ 9:01 amActually many people
        tried it and then left a comment and said it came out great. I
        even had other bloggers post on their experience. I’ve also made
        it many times and it comes out great and does not taste of sweet
        eggs. And eggs can be transformed when they are whipped so that
        they don’t taste like eggs. Take meringue cookies for example or
        chocolate souffles.

    pmVery](http://kirbiecravings.com:80/#comment-134985) disappointed.
    Was excited to try this as the boyfriend and I are Nutella fiends
    and fans of other simple, flourless (even eggy) cakes. Was hugely
    let down at the result – a spongy, eggy mildly sweet cake – barely a
    hint of Nutella shining through. Too good to be true, I suppose.

    pmHi](http://kirbiecravings.com:80/#comment-138541). This cake is
    amazing!! I was worried after some of the negative comments and I
    don’t really like quiche because it can be to “eggy” for me. But no
    eggy taste in my cake. It’s not the prettiest but its yummy.
    Followed the directions exactly – 4 large eggs beaten with an
    electric hand beater in a glass bowl for 6 mins timed on my phone.
    The Nutella measured out at 240 grams. Melted the Nutella slightly
    and added the eggs in thirds. 25 mins later — Perfect!! Give this
    recipe a go. It’s worth trying at least. Very happy

    I first tried it, 1.5-2 hours after it was baked, but when it cools
    completely after maybe 4 hours it doesn’t anymore. Still tasteless
    though. I can’t tell what I did wrong, even though I’m not a
    beginner in cooking and I do know when I did something wrong and it
    tastes not as it was intended to. But in this case I really can not
    imagine the intended taste, so I could make mine better the next
    time I try it (just to prove myself wrong).

    pmI](http://kirbiecravings.com:80/#comment-142712)’m going to make
    this working on a theory–which is I’m letting the eggs get to room
    temperature before I work them. I also measured the ‘business’ out
    of the Nutella (3/4 cup) which I put into a see-through glass
    measuring cup and microwaved until it was liquid enough to make
    absolutely certain that it was 3/4 of a cup. Then I added the + 1
    TBSP. All of this has been sitting out for a couple of hours. And,
    simply because where I nanny (we’re making this for the dad’s
    birthday) only has either one VERY large Springform, or two very
    little ones, we’re going with the two little ones, and then putting
    them together with a wee bit of buttercream-coconut frosting in
    between. Hopefully, there will be enough for me to taste tomorrow so
    I can tell you how it went!

    pmOkay](http://kirbiecravings.com:80/#comment-144906), here are my
    results. 1: ended up using the bigger pan once I saw the HUGENESS of
    the fluffy eggs, which of course dial themselves down a bunch one
    you start mixing in the Nutella.\
    2: my cake was ugly due to my ineptness with the parchment paper.\
    3: I agree with whomever said above that waiting until the cake is
    completely cool (at the very least) is the first time it should be
    tried. It did seem quite eggy yesterday, but today much less so.
    Also, the consistency of the cake matches the picture more today.\
    4: I wonder if high altitude has anything to do with anything\
    5: I wonder what would happen if I mixed the nutella in with the
    eggs using the beater on the lowest setting (which still seems sort
    of rough). Neither \#4 or \#5 have anything really to do with
    anything, I think the cake turned out fine. AND probably was really
    good with the almond/buttermilk/coconut frosting I made, however it
    got left out over night and that frightened me.Thanks for the fun!

        replied: — December 12th, 2012 @ 1:33 pmI think high altitude
        will effect it, but I don’t know by how much. I’ve never tried
        eating the cake warm. I always let mine cool completely. I guess
        I didn’t realize people were eating it before it cooled
        completely until now. But thanks for sharing your results and
        I’m glad it worked out for the most part. I would still avoid
        mixing the Nutella with a mixer. I definitely think folding it
        by hand is best.

    [9:31 pmBit](http://kirbiecravings.com:80/#comment-152066) of a
    mixed review, I’m afraid.\
    I was looking forward to this all last week, and have made decadent
    flourless chocolate cakes before. The technique is fantastic –
    whipping whole eggs; yay! I got good volume and didn’t deflate it
    much stirring in the (perfectly measured and prewarmed) Nutella.\
    The cake baked up perfectly (looks exactly like the pic) but
    honestly, sadly, the flavour was not fantastic. As a previous
    reviewer said, the Nutella doesn’t really shine through as richly as
    it perhaps could have. Maybe it needs a ground-hazelnut “kick”? It’s
    a fine, easy cake, but not exactly decadent the way good brownies or
    fudge is – and it can’t beat a spoonful of Nutella.
    ![](http://kirbiecravings.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif)\
    Will definitely keep this in mind for the Passover season when we
    don’t use flour, as it is a fabulous technique!

    had this the next day, almost exactly 24 hours later. I’m not saying

    I hope I haven’t sounded ungracious. I think it turned out

    again – maybe with a flavour extract or Frangelico / amaretto for a
    bit more of a hazelnutty kick.

        replied: — December 16th, 2012 @ 11:13 amOh, I see. Yeah, it’s

    amAm](http://kirbiecravings.com:80/#comment-178781) going to try
    this out but just wondering, how long will it take to cool, and how
    do you actually fold the Nutella? thanks!

        replied: — December 29th, 2012 @ 10:19 amFolding is a baking
        term. You basically take a spatula and you mix in the same
        direction (usually clockwise for me). You sort of lift some of
        the batter up, then mix it with the rest, but rather than just
        stirring, it is more of a folding gesture. You can take a look
        at this video, at 1 min 46 seconds in, this person shows how to
        fold for macarons.

    pmI](http://kirbiecravings.com:80/#comment-185774) didn’t read all
    the comments to see if anyone else already posted this – but I
    measured 8.5 ounces of nutella to be 13 tablespoons. I hope this
    helps!

    pmNutella](http://kirbiecravings.com:80/#comment-197597) omelet . I
    have been a fan of Nutella since I went to Europe 20 years ago. I
    was so eager to try this recipe . Whoaaa it was pretty bad. Tasted
    like eggs.with chocolate. I thought I made a mistake somewhere , but
    I found several comments on the egg taste. What a waste of good
    Nutella …

        replied: — January 7th, 2013 @ 11:39 pmI’m sorry yours didn’t
        turn out but the fact that it tastes like nutella eggs is not
        right. Yes a few people ended up with Nutella eggs, but you’ll
        also see a lot of people who had success. Yes, if it’s not made
        right it will just taste like eggs and Nutella, but if it’s made
        right it won’t.

    wouldn’t dream of posting your recipe on my blog, simply a picture

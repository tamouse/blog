Photographer [Mark Laita](http://www.marklaita.com/water.html) has taken
his superb eye beneath the waves to focus on the extraordinary creatures
who inhabit the depths of the vast ocean. The collection which came out
of these brilliant images is entitled Sea, and its purpose was to show
"the grace and diversity of sea creatures reflected against the surface
of their world." Laita has succeeded in bringing the wonderment of the
ocean and it's mysterious creatures to life by taking these brightly
colored subjects and placing them against a stark black backdrop, which
helps to intensify the viewing experience.

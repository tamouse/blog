<div id="wikitext">

I used to have a nice notebook that contained all sorts of recipes I've
collected and invented over the years. Unfortunately, I lost that book
somewhere along the way. So now I've taken to writing the recipes I
encounter here in the wiki so they can't really be lost.

I love to cook! It's one thing I do really well. I'm more adventurous
than it may at first appear here. I had some wonderful recipes before, I
hope to recreate them as I go along.

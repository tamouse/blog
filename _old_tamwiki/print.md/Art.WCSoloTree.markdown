Value Study

The value study started out in one direction, but because of what
happened during the painting of the mid-values, it ended up going in
quite another!

I mixed equal parts of French Ultramarine and Quinn Burnt Orange fresh
from the tubes into a well in my palette. These two make a lustrous
black, much better than using Payne's Grey or even Black from the Prang
palette.

I started with the darkest blacks, the tree trunk and branches, which is
unusual for a value study as you are supposed to go from the lightest
values to the darkest values. I decided since the trunk and branches
were going to be central to the structure of the painting to start with
them instead.

Next I moved on to the lightest values in the leaves. Instead of
following the photo in this case, I made quite different strokes, thin
and elongated, rather than a more leafy approach (which you'll see in
the colour version below).

Moving on from there to the mid-values, I started with the ground square
from below the tree up to a mid-point in back of it, doing a gradiated
wash, darkest in front, lightest in back. I didn't try to make it an
even gradation, as I wanted there to be some interest in the field. I
also did not try to stick to the lines of the square, wanting to free it
up some.

</div>

From there, I moved on to the mid-tone area in the leafy part of the
tree itself. As you can see above, the QBO started to separate from the
French Ultramarine and move away from the wash. The brush was very wet,
which I think is what caused this. It is also likely I had not mixed the
paint very thoroughly. But the result is really interesting and I like
it quite a lot!

Work In Progress: Colour Version of Solo Tree
---------------------------------------------

### Sky and Ground

</div>

*(Apologies for the out-of-focus image.)* Changing the original photo's
setting, I put the solo tree into a park-like setting, with open sky
above and a grassy field below. The sky was a gradated wet-on-wet wash
of Cerulean Blue, darker and the top than at the bottom.

I had inverted the paper, so the top was facing me, and was propped up
on a chunk of kneadable eraser. This let me drop the Cerulean Blue in
and let it seep down the page to where I'd stopped the wash. I love
working this way, just letting the paint run where it will, as it will.

I blotted some areas in the upper sky to give some faint cloud
impressions. I tried to keep the majority of the tree's leave portion
from getting the wash, but let a little go on.

Turning the paper back to normal upright position, I started with the
ground area. I mixed Phthalo Green with New Gamboge and just a touch of
QBO to start, and started filling in the grassy area, wet on dry. I kept
some areas clear, and started to paint over with just New Gamboge, then
again with QBO, getting wetter and wetter and sort of sliding the paint
around a bit. I blotted some areas in the back part of the grassy area
to lighten them a bit. I also made sure the sky area was not completely
dry and trailed the lighter greenish colour a little into it so it would
seep up the page a touch, giving some interest in the background.

### Leaves

</div>

The leaves went on in a pointilist or daubing fashion, far different
from the monochrome version above. Although the source picture shows the
leaves having quite a bit of blue in the red (making a deep fuchsia or
magenta), I decided to go another way and use unmixed and nearly pure
Cadmium Red Scarlet, which has a bit of orange in the tint. This made
the leaves much brighter than the original, which i like.

Next, I mixed a bit of Phthalo Green in with the Scarlet (just a teensy
touch!! Ph.Green is **so** strong a pigment!) to darken it a bit and
daubed this on as an underlayer to the pure Scarlet. Finally, I mixed
Ph.Green, New Gamboge and just a bit of Scarlet to make the lighter
green leaves. Finally, I mixed Ph.Green with Scarlet to get a darker
green to start filling in the dark parts of the leaf bundle.

Composition Problems
--------------------

It was here that I began to see problems in the composition:

</div>

The painting was split 50:50 horizontally and vertically, which makes it
uninteresting. I decided to crop the bottom quarter of the picture
(using photoshop -- the original painting is still full size) and like
it much better:

This works much better, I feel.

Final works

This is the final full size version of the coloured painting. It shows
the compositional problems of being completely centered horizontally and
vertically.

### Fixing Composition

<div>

<span style="font-size:83%"> Final colour version, cropped to improve
the composition. Image cropped in photoshop. Original watercolour on

</div>

To fix the composition, I took the digital image above, and pulled it
into photoshop. I played around with various different crops to see
which I liked the best, and this was the result. I resampled it and blew
it up to 2761x4000 pixels, 300dpi, so it would make a nice print if
someone wanted one. I did buy a print from deviant art (below) and it
looks gorgeous.

I do love tree trunks, and I do love how I'm getting them done. I may do
a tutorial on them some time.

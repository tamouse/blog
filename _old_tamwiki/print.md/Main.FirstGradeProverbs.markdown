As you shall make your bed so shall you...

...mess it up.

Better be safe than...

...punch a 5th grader.

Strike while the ...

...bug is close.

It's always darkest before...

...daylight savings time.

You can lead a horse to water but...

...how?

Don't bite the hand that...

...looks dirty.

A miss is as good as a...

...Mr.

You can't teach an old dog new...

...math.

If you lie down with the dogs, you'll...

...stink in the morning.

The pen is mightier than the...

...pigs.

An idle mind is...

...the best way to relax.

Where there's smoke, there's...

...pollution.

Happy the bride who...

...gets all the presents.

A penny saved is...

...not much.

Two's company, three's...

...the musketeers.

Laugh and the whole world laughs with you; cry and...

...you have to blow your nose.

Children should be seen and not...

...spanked or grounded.

When the blind leadeth the blind...

...get out of the way.

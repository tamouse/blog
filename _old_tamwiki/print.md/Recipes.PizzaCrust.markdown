This recipe from my friends Cymru and Alaric is just like the recipe I
used to have for pizza crust before I lost my recipe notebook. It's good
to see it again!

This makes enough for one large pizza, and the crust should be firm
enough to slide into your oven on a pizza peel (no pan required). For
best results, use a preheated pizza stone, or line the bottom of your
oven with unglazed terracotta tiles (about \$12 a box at your local
builders' supply store).

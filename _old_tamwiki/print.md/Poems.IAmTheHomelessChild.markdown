I am the Homeless Child
-----------------------

No one cares\
No one notices\
That I am all alone\
No shoulder to lean on\
No one to lift my spirits\
No one to express my feelings to\
No place to call my own\
I am the homeless child\
Roaming the streets at night\
Growing old without love\
God its hard to explain\
I wonder if its really worth the fight\
To stay alive in this cold cruel world\
I am the homeless child\
Sleeping on the streets at night\
Searching the bins for something to eat\
My pride not allowing myself to beg\
Preferring to go without instead\
My helplessness driving me insane\
But surviving none the less\
Wishing I could give up\
No one would miss me if I did

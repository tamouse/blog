Shortcakes
==========

These are really just slightly modified drop biscuits. Nothing special
here, really. <span id="ingredients"></span>

Ingredients
-----------

-   1.25 cups bisquick, or other biscuit mix
-   1/3 cup milk, more or less
-   1 teaspoon vanilla
-   1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

<span id="directions"></span>

Directions
----------

1.  Heat oven to 450â„‰.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

2.  Combine bisquick, milk, vanilla, and cinnamon, stir until just
    mixed, don't over beat. Dough will be rather sticky.

    </div>

3.  Drop dough onto baking sheet, the amounts given should make 3 good
    sized biscuits. Flatten a little bit.
    <div class="vspace">

    </div>

4.  Bake for 10-12 minutes until biscuits are light brown.

Strawberries
============

Fresh strawberries in season cannot be beat. I like a lot of
strawberries, usually using one of the 2-pint containers for this.

Ingredients
-----------

-   Fresh strawberries
-   Sweetener (plain sugar works great, but other sweeteners can work as
    well)

Directions
----------

1.  Wash strawberries thoroughly

3.  Mix sweetener of choice over cut up strawberries

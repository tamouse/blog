<p class='vspace'>This recipe came from Nelly Starr, a former patient of my uncle John's. She used to make him these cakes all the time. My aunt Marcie finally convinced him to ask her for the recipe. My cousin Kate responded with "You know, Mom, if you ask her for the recipe, she'll never make another cake for Dad." And it was true! Nevertheless, we have the recipe secured.

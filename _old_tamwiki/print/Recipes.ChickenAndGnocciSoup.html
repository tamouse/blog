</p><h2>Comments</h2>
<p>This soup is a great use of leftover chicken, but in my case I just cooked chicken tenders that I seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder in the oven at 350 degrees for 20-30 minutes, until done. Also, you can find the gnocchi in the pasta section of your grocery store.

<div class='vspace'></div><h2>How Many Friends Have You? </h2>
<div class='indent'><em>~ author unknown ~</em>
</div><p class='vspace'>The old man turned to me and asked
<br  />"How many friends have you?"
<br  />Why 10 or 20 friends have I,
<br  />And named off just a few ~
</p>
<p class='vspace'>He rose quite slow with effort
<br  />And sadly shook his head
<br  />"A lucky child you are
<br  />To have so many friends," he said,
<br  />But think of what you're saying
<br  />There is so much you do not know
<br  />A friend is just not someone
<br  />To whom you say "Hello"
</p>
<p class='vspace'>A friend's a tender shoulder
<br  />On which to softly cry
<br  />As well to pour your troubles down
<br  />And raise your spirits high
</p>
<p class='vspace'>A friend is a hand to pull you up
<br  />From darkness and despair...
<br  />When all your other "so called" friends
<br  />Have helped to put you there
</p>
<p class='vspace'>A true friend is an ally
<br  />Who can't be moved or bought
<br  />A voice to keep your name alive
<br  />When others have forgot
</p>
<p class='vspace'>But most of all a friend is a heart
<br  />A strong and sturdy wall
<br  />For from the hearts of friends
<br  />There comes the greatest love of all !!!
</p>
<p class='vspace'>So think of what I've spoken
<br  />For every word is true
<br  />And answer once again my child
<br  />How many friends have you??
</p>
<p class='vspace'>And then he stood and faced me
<br  />Awaiting my reply
<br  />Softly I answered
<br  />"If lucky ...
<br  />one have "I" ...
<br  />"You!!!!"

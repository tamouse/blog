<p class='vspace'>This is a recreation of a recipe I had made up in my old recipe book. This is basically what I remember, but it could probably use some tweaking.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul><li>2 pounds tortellini pasta, cooked al dente and cooled.
</li><li>1/2 cup feta cheese, crumbled.
</li><li>1/4 cup olive oil
</li><li>1/4 cup red wine vinegar
</li><li>1/8 teaspoon dry mustard
</li><li>1 cup snow peas, cut into bite-sized pieces and blanched.
</li><li>2-3 scallions or green onions, diced
</li><li>salt &amp; pepper to taste
</li><li>a few sprigs of fresh parsley, chopped (1/2 a bunch?)
</li></ul><div class='vspace'></div><h2>Directions</h2>
<ol><li>Cook the pasta until it is al dente. Tortellini floats when it is done. Drain and cool in cold water.
</li><li>Cut up the snow peas into bite-sized pieces and blanche in boiling water for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Drain and cool in cold water.
</li><li>Whisk the oil, vinegar and mustard.
</li><li>Combine the cooled tortellini, snow peas, chopped green onions and crumbled feta cheese, salt &amp; pepper, chopped parsley, and toss with the dressing.
</li><li>Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.
</li></ol><div class='vspace'></div><h2>Variations</h2>
<p>Today, 30 July 2011, I didn't have all the above ingredients, yet I wanted to get the tortellini used before it went bad. I made the following substitutions:
</p><ul><li>For feta, I used gorgonzolla, and added a bit of parmesan
</li><li>Instead of dry mustard, I used a bit of yellow mustard
</li><li>Instead of snow peas, I used regular frozen peas
</li><li>I added a dash of ground thyme and oregano
</li><li>I used about 2 tablespoons of dry parsley instead of fresh.
</li></ul><p class='vspace'>I whisked all the spices and herbs together with the oil, vinegar and mustard and let it sit for a bit while the pasta and peas were cooking.

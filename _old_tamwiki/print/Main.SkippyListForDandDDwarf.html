<p class='vspace'>Things Skippy the Dwarf Fighter has learned or been told while dungeon delving, or is no longer allowed to do while delving.
Dwarf Snorri Snorrison son of Snorrison's son ('Skippy' to friends and enemies alike), has been a party member of the &#34;Lost Empire&#34; campaign for several years. His adventuring behavior has been corrected from time to time, for not being appropriate for a dungeon delve. The list is almost entirely composed of The Word he was given as a response to an action or event he was involved with. 
</p><ol><li>After the &#34;Dark Vessel&#34; adventure, everyone who ever loved me is dead. I'm not allowed to brag about that anymore. 
</li><li>Aftershave is not to be applied with a putty knife. 
</li><li>Although I do think I could do a better job and I would like to lead, these questions usually turn out not to be sincere. 
</li><li>Anything I say after &#34;it's worth noting&#34; is usually not interesting to anyone else in the party. 
</li><li>Basilisks cannot be hypnotized by winning a staring contest with them. 
</li><li>Battle axes are not the sniper's weapon of choice so I should get off the roof and engage the enemy. 
</li><li>Battle axes don't have a stun setting. 
</li><li>Clerics can move in all directions, not just diagonally. 
</li><li>Clerics that are dragged to a tavern for a night of celebratory quaffing should be returned to their devotions within 4 to 6 working days (or within two High Holy Days, whichever comes first). 
</li><li>Dark Gods require virgin sacrifices; incantations do not require virgin spell components. It is wrong to ask the mage how he knows his frog's eyes come from a virgin frog. 
</li><li>Draft horses are not missile weapons. 
</li><li>Dragon breath is not funny. 
</li><li>Dragons do not dispense their hoard in lotteries, and there's no way I &#34;may already be a winner.&#34; 
</li><li>'Dropping Trou&#34; is not a fighter class &#34;special attack.&#34; 
</li><li>Elf ears do not require sharpening. 
</li><li>For all that he's an illiterate man, the seneschal can read me like a book. 
</li><li>For customs inspectors, &#34;Declare&#34; has a specific meaning that does not involve reciting my heritage back to the &#34;Time Of Troubles.&#34; 
</li><li>Get down off the altar. 
</li><li>Gifts from The Gods do not come with an exchange coupon for Harrod's Mercantile and Chandler shop. 
</li><li>God-calls are not protected as Free Speech. 
</li><li>He did not &#34;start it.&#34; 
</li><li>He is not kidding. 
</li><li>He is not on &#34;my side of the dungeon.&#34; 
</li><li>He really means it this time. 
</li><li>Holy Relics of Fantastic Power do not have a shelf-life date. 
</li><li>&#34;Hungry&#34; is not an alignment. 
</li><li>Neither is &#34;stupid,&#34; but in my case, they're willing to make an exception. 
</li><li>I am not allowed to make explosives, even if I do have all the supplies. 
</li><li>I am not allowed to render any member of my party to obtain those supplies. 
</li><li>I am not the default love interest and should stay away from any non-dwarf royalty we encounter. 
</li><li>I am not the evil twin, but only because I don't have a twin. 
</li><li>I am not the Grey Poupon distributor for the kingdom, and I cannot ladle it onto the illusionist and offer him to dragons as a free sample. 
</li><li>I am not the Grey Poupon distributor for the kingdom, and I should stop giving dragons a discount on the stuff. 
</li><li>I am not the rightful heir to the Burger King, I'm just telling a whopper. 
</li><li>I cannot improve my defenses by writing &#34;-10 Armor Class&#34; on my shirt. 
</li><li>I don't get to keep chaotic monsters that followed me home unless I intend to skin them. 
</li><li>I don't know what I was thinking when I said the longbowman was &#34;out of ammo&#34; after six shots. 
</li><li>I don't want you to turn this adventure around. 
</li><li>I should stop screaming about &#34;the power of grayskull&#34; and take cover from the crossbows. 
</li><li>I should stop writing &#34;Bite Me&#34; in orcish on my party leader's shield. 
</li><li>Must stop writing ANYTHING in orcish on party members&#34; shields. 
</li><li>&#34;I was bored&#34; is not an excuse for anything done with a loaded ballista. 
</li><li>I was not placed in charge of the prisoners so that I could slaughter them and &#34;the paladin wouldn't get his hands dirty.&#34; 
</li><li>I was not seduced by the Demon Queen of Pormax, and the scars from that adventure are not &#34;love tattoos.&#34; 
</li><li>If I sing &#34;I'm A Lumberjack and I'm Okay&#34; just one more time, they're gonna make me eat my axe. 
</li><li>If it looked like a duck, quacked like a duck, and tasted like a duck, but had a collar indicating it's sacred to a local goddess, we should skip dessert and start running. 
</li><li>In joining a group of adventurers, the party leader does actually become the boss of me, and I should respond accordingly in combat. 
</li><li>In my case, &#34;innocent until proven guilty&#34; is an offense against the gods. 
</li><li>In my case, an aphorism indicating &#34;that's when you find out who your friends really are&#34; is just noise in the wind. 
</li><li>Inquisitors have no sense of humor. They also don't like this fact pointed out to them. 
</li><li>It is wrong to greet Inquisitors by shouting &#34;stick to the story!&#34; to other party members. 
</li><li>It is not motivational to talk about adventure parties that died in situations &#34;just like this.&#34; 
</li><li>It is so my fault. 
</li><li>It is wrong to enhance my codpiece for dramatic effect. 
</li><li>It is wrong to make the evil sorceress cry by mentioning her biological clock, ticking away. 
</li><li>The cleric feels it is wrong to behead someone who's crying. Noted. 
</li><li>It is wrong to splice centerfolds into the mage's grimoires. 
</li><li>It is wrong to tell dying heroes they've been downsized and their valuables seized. 
</li><li>It is wrong to use exploding shuriken to gather firewood when there's a Druid in the party. 
</li><li>It is wrong to write &#34;First come, first serve&#34; on the wagon when we're hired to protect the tax collector. 
</li><li>It would not have worked if it weren't for those meddling kids. 
</li><li>It's a Monarchy based on Oral Law. There is no Free Speech. 
</li><li>It's never too early to tell the others where I packed the healing potions. 
</li><li>Labels on the vials of potions are not the sign of a weak mind, they're really a good idea. 
</li><li>Labels on the vials of potions should be popular names in a common tongue, not pictionary graphics. 
</li><li>Evidently I cannot draw a clear &#34;healer&#34; to save my life. 
</li><li>It's not important who's right and who's wrong as long as the party leader is right. 
</li><li>Jousting is the sport of knights on horseback, not dwarves on dining tables. 
</li><li>Kilroy was NOT here and he'd better stop putting graffiti in the castle. 
</li><li>Knowing how to burp fire and NEEDING to burp fire are two different things. 
</li><li>Knowing three swear words in thieves cant does not make me a dual class fighter/thief. 
</li><li>Leave the animation of the dead to professionals. 
</li><li>Leave the noble art of chirurgery to the professionals. 
</li><li>Magic wands do not experience &#34;recoil&#34; so I don't need to brace the short-skirted sorceress every time she casts a spell. 
</li><li>Membership in the waterferryman's guild does not allow me to charge passengers for space on a lifeboat. 
</li><li>Mirrored sun glasses are not period ware.

</li><li>Must not delay the party's attack on the fire dragon while I &#34;get the s'mores ready.&#34; 
</li><li>Must not hire a soapmaker to make a half-ton cake of soap, attach axles, and drive it to the king's castle as a gift &#34;from concerned friends.&#34; 
</li><li>Ditto the alchemist, half ton breathmint, the queen, &#34;loving but scandalized subjects.&#34; 
</li><li>Must not hire ladies of negotiable affections to follow the cleric back to his temple and commend him to the bishop for the sexual healing he performed.

</li><li>Not to repeat the Barbarian's comments on the usefulness of women adventurers to the cleric while she's treating his wounds. 
</li><li>Oh, stop screaming. 
</li><li>Our druid has never decided a wounded party member was beyond help and turned first-aid into a sacrifice to The Dark One. Well, not anymore. 
</li><li>Paladin party leaders don't have to explain all command decisions, especially to chaotic stupid dwarves. 
</li><li>Putting cotton in my ears does not make me move silently in plate armor. 
</li><li>Religious tracts should not be handed out every time we meet a party of orcs.

</li><li>The Paladin's horse is off limits to anyone with a meat cleaver and a bottle of bar-b-q sauce. 
</li><li>The party wizard is not undead, and I must stop congratulating him for &#34;passing&#34; as a living being. 
</li><li>The phrase &#34;can't possibly miss&#34; is way overused. 
</li><li>The wages of sin are NOT &#34;heaps and heaps of slightly smelly treasure.&#34;

</li><li>There is no ominous &#34;background music&#34; telling me the monster's getting closer.

</li><li>There is no such language as pig-druid, so stop practicing it. 
</li><li>There is nothing under the sorcerer's gown that is of any interest to a fellow party member. 
</li><li>There's no such thing as a Dwarven Death Grip. 
</li><li>Throwing Halflings off a cliff to see how big a splat they make is not a competitive sport. 
</li><li>Not allowed to spend time on watch developing a scoring system for Halfling-splat. 
</li><li>Treason's such a harsh word. 
</li><li>Triage categories are not (1) Me, (2) You all, I guess, and (3) Those other geeks. 
</li><li>Triage is performed according to the nature of the wounds, not the amount of gold they're carrying. 
</li><li>Turns out, the Ranger DOES care what his deity-gift magical arrow was last fired at. 
</li><li>Turns out, when I'm told &#34;you wouldn't dare&#34; they're usually wrong. 
</li><li>Twenty seven lice in my hair and beard do not qualify me as a leader of a guerilla army of infiltration specialists. 
</li><li>Under most circumstances, no one cares to see how many gold pieces I can fit into a goblin's skull. 
</li><li>Unloaded crossbows should not be fired in jest. 
</li><li>Valhalla is not the final destination of those that die owing more than a million gold to creditors. 
</li><li>Violating treaties is not an &#34;icebreaker&#34; for diplomatic missions. 
</li><li>Voices in my head are not &#34;in a position to know.&#34; 
</li><li>War cries should be shouted, not delivered by messenger or sung by off-side cheerleaders. 
</li><li>We did not recruit the Halfling just in case we need a virgin sacrifice. Stop telling him that. 
</li><li>We do not delay returning the princess to the king in order to solicit competing bids. 
</li><li>We do not run credit checks on royalty when hired to rescue the princess. 
</li><li>We do not shout &#34;Circle of Life, Dude!&#34; and leave the wounded behind. 
</li><li>We will not laugh about all of this in a year or two. 
</li><li>We're here to kill orcs, not moon them. 
</li><li>When a party member is beset by multiple opponents, I will render all possible aid. I will never again stand by, telling the rest of the party &#34;He needs to prove himself against the Dragon&mdash;and his own fears.&#34; 
</li><li>When carrying the wounded half-orc back to camp, I should not cut him in two to save the human half first. 
</li><li>When cave bears hit cave bears it means love. When cave bears hit party members it means war, and I should not shout &#34;get a room, you two!'
</li><li>When Death lets us challenge him in order to stay alive, we will pick a board game, not Whack-A-Toad. 
</li><li>When small harmless people shapechange to large slavering monsters, my most immediate reaction is not to try to calculate just how much mass seems to have been hidden/ignored in the transformation. 
</li><li>When someone says &#34;It's over,&#34; not allowed to tell the cleric it's her cue to sing. 
</li><li>When someone says &#34;some of you, and you know who you are&#34; everyone in the party knows they're looking at me. 
</li><li>When the Oracle offers us the answers to any three questions, not allowed to pull out my Zen For Dummies book and ask about 1 hand clapping. 
</li><li>When the party leader is hanging from the face of the cliff, I must find a rope before starting a &#34;how long can he hold on&#34; pool. 
</li><li>When the reptiloids are sacrificing to their dark gods, and they don't know where the heart is on an elf, I should not whip out a grease pencil and provide visual aids. 
</li><li>When they say "over my dead body" I should assume it's hyperbole until proven to be literal, not the other way around. 
</li><li>When they say &#34;fire at will&#34; they don't mean Lord William. 
</li><li>Wrong to tell the cleric she has exceeded her daily limit on whining. 
</li><li>Xylophone music is not required in order to fight skeletons. 
</li><li>Yes, the hierophant does worship Lacedos God of Light, I should stop asking. 
</li><li>Yes, there really are such things as innocent bystanders.

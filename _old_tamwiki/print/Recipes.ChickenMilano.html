</li><li>1 cup heavy cream
</li><li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
</li><li>salt and pepper to taste
</li><li><del>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</del> <em>(I tend to not use oil much for saut??ing things like chicken -- a light spray of PAM is usually all I do)</em>

</li><li>8 ounces dry fettuccini pasta
</li></ul><p class='vspace'><a name='directions' id='directions'></a>
</p><h2>Directions</h2>
<ol><li>In a large saucepan over low heat, melt butter; add garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes and 3/4 cup of the chicken broth; increase to medium heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 10 minutes or until the tomatoes are tender. Add the cream and bring to a boil; stirring. Simmer over medium heat until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
</li><li>Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides. In a large skillet over medium heat, warm oil and saute chicken. Press on chicken occasionally with a slotted spatula. Cook for about 4 minutes per side or until the meat feels springy and is no longer pink inside. Transfer to a board; cover and keep warm. Discard the fat from the skillet.
</li><li>In the same skillet, over medium heat, bring 1/4 cup chicken broth to a boil; stirring the pan juices. Reduce slightly and add to the cream sauce; stir in basil and adjust seasonings to taste.
</li><li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccine and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain, transfer to a bowl and toss with 3 to 4 tablespoons of the sauce.
</li><li>Cut each chicken breast into 2 to 3 diagonal slices. Reheat the sauce gently if needed. Transfer the pasta to serving plates; top with chicken and coat with the cream sauce; serve.

</p><h2>Comments</h2>
<p>As I've mentioned <a class='wikilink' href='http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Recipes.BalsamicChicken?action=print'>elsewhere</a>, cubing the chicken before you cook it will help ensure it is completely done.

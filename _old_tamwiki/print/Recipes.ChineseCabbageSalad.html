<p class='vspace'>There's very little about this recipe that is Chinese. The ramen is japanese, for example. It calls for red wine vinegar instead of rice vinegar as well. Broccoli slaw instead of shredded chinese cabbage.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>I had another recipe for Chinese Chicken Salad that I hope to recreate someday, but this looks pretty serviceable for now, just add some cooked chicken to it.

</p><h2>Comments</h2>
<p>I have not tried this recipe to be sure, but the vinegar:oil ratios seem really off to me. I'd also use rice wine vinegar instead of red wine+sugar for more authenticity. Also, instead of broccoli slaw (although it sounds good) for more authenticity I'd use shredded Chinese cabbage.

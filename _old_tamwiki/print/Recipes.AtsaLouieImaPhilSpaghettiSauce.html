<p class='vspace'>This is a recipe from the Palermo Brothers, a comedy duo, who had the famous tag line "'Atsa Louie, I'ma Phil". This appeared in their autobiography of that name. I am pretty sure it's out of print now, but you can pick up facsimiles still. This recipe appeared in the paper, which is how I got it. It's a winner!

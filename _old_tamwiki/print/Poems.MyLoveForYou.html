<div class='vspace'></div><h1>My Love For You</h1>
<p>I hear your name, it lights my way
<br  />You're what I miss, I won't feel the same
<br  />Until you're walking with me
</p>
<p class='vspace'>We've come a long way, but we're not too sure
<br  />We've been on the path, feel like we walked so long
<br  />Strolled hand in hand with love
</p>
<p class='vspace'>I need someone to hold, a special kind of something
<br  />Nobody said that I would feel this pain
<br  />When I'm all alone, I've got something to give
</p>
<p class='vspace'>I am thinking of you in my sleepless solitude
<br  />I'd risk my life to feel your body next to mine
<br  />Babe can you feel me, imagine I'm looking in your eyes
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Sometimes you don't expect that friends can become lovers
<br  />So hold me close and don't let go, 'cause this is love, boy
<br  />And we are gonna be together for eternity, its with you I belong
<br  />Because I'm in love with you, this is love
</p>
<p class='vspace'>I'll be loving you forever deep inside my heart
<br  />There is no-one in this world who can love me like you do
<br  />So many reasons that I want to spend my life forever with you
</p>
<p class='vspace'>If we love each other, we wont go that way
<br  />So put aside your doubts do what it takes to make it right
<br  />'cause I love you forever, no-one can tear us apart
</p>
<p class='vspace'>You are my life and you're the last thing on my mind
<br  />Before I go to sleep at night, your always around
<br  />When I need you, when trouble is on my mind
</p>
<p class='vspace'>I love you eternally
</p>

<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul><li><del>3</del> <ins>2</ins> eggs
</li><li>1.5 cups finely grated pecorino romano cheese (plus more for serving)
</li><li>2 tablespoons olive oil
</li><li>6 ounces diced guanciale or pancetta
</li><li>salt, to taste (the romano cheese and the guanciale/pancetta are pretty salty already)
</li><li>6 ounces dried spaghetti
</li><li>freshly ground black pepper, to taste
</li></ul><div class='vspace'></div><h2>Directions</h2>
<ol><li>in a bowl, whisk together eggs and romano cheese
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Heat oil in a skillet to medium, fry up the guanciale or pancetta until browned and fat has rendered. <em>(Here, the W-S recipe does not call for draining the fat from the meat, just setting it aside instead. I'd suggest getting rid of at least some of the fat.)</em>
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil, add the pasta and cook until <em>al dent??</em>. Drain, reserving about 1 cup of the cooking water.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>slowly whisk 1/2 cup of pasta water into egg-cheese mixture.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>return skillet to medium heat and rewarm. Add the pasta and 1/4 cup reserved pasta water; toss to combine. Remove pan from heat. Pour in egg mixture; toss well to combine.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Season generously with ground black pepper.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Serve at once, do not let the eggs cook too much (like not at all!)
</li></ol><div class='vspace'></div><h2>Comments</h2>
<p>Spaghetti or vermicelli are long, thin pasta. Sometimes it's easier to deal with them if you break them into thirds before cooking them.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>I think useful additions to the spicing would be basil and possibly even a touch of peppermint, although way not traditional.

<ul><li>1/2 cup parmesan instead of romano
</li><li>maple flavoured bacon instead of pancetta
</li><li>1 medium onion
</li><li>1 teaspoon minced garlic
</li><li>1 teaspoon dried basil
</li><li>1 teaspoon dried oregano
</li><li>3 ounces frozen corn kernels
</li><li>1 can sliced mushrooms
</li></ul><div class='vspace'></div><ol><li>whisk the eggs, parmesan and spices together.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>sautee the chopped onions, garlic and mushrooms until the onions have turned translucent. Set aside.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>cut up the bacon and fry until done. Drain on paper towels.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>boil the pasta and corn together.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>pour 1/3 cup hot pasta water into egg-cheese-spice mixture before combining.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>omit the water from the final combining step.
</li></ol><div class='vspace'></div><h4>Notes: </h4>
<ul><li>This would probably have been a better without the maple flavoured bacon and onions -- the final dish was more sweet than savoury.
</li><li>It definitely needed more cheese.
</li><li>I think the eggs need to set more, so tossing everything together on the heat and letting the eggs cook more would be beneficial. 3 eggs is also way too much for the amount of pasta used. Another recipe called for 2 eggs to a pound of pasta; since here I only used 6 ounces of pasta, 2 eggs would definitely be better than 3.

I just wanted to let you know that I have recently been diagnosed with
AAADD - <strong>Age Activated Attention Deficit Disorder.</strong>
<a name='excerptend' id='excerptend'></a>
</p>
<p class='vspace'>This is how it goes . .
</p>
<p class='vspace'>I decide to do the laundry, start down the hall and notice the
newspaper on table.  OK, I'm going to do the laundry . . .  BUT FIRST
I'm going to read the newspaper.  After that, I notice the mail on the
table. OK, I'll just put the newspaper in the recycle stack . . .
</p>
<p class='vspace'>BUT FIRST I'll look through the pile of mail and see if there are any
bills to be paid. Yes. Now where is the checkbook?  Oops .
. . there's the empty glass from yesterday on the coffee table.  I'm
going to look for that checkbook . . .
</p>
<p class='vspace'>BUT FIRST I need to put the glass in the sink.  I head for the
kitchen, look out the window, notice my poor flowers need a drink of
water.  I put the glass in the sink and there's the remote for the TV
on the kitchen counter.  What's it doing here? I'll just put it away
. . .
</p>
<p class='vspace'>BUT FIRST I need to water those plants.  I head for the door and . . .
Aaaagh! stepped on the cat.  Cat needs to be fed.  Okay, I'll put the
remote away and water the plants . . .
</p>
<p class='vspace'>BUT FIRST I need to feed the cat.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>END OF DAY: Laundry is not done, newspapers are still on the floor,
glass is still in the sink, bills are not paid, checkbook is still
lost, and the cat ate the remote control . . .  And, when I try to
figure out how come nothing got done today, I'm baffled because . . . I KNOW I WAS BUSY ALL DAY!  I realize this condition is serious
I'd get help . . .
</p>
<p class='vspace'>BUT FIRST . . . I think I'll check my e-mail . . .

<div class='round lrindent quote' > 
<p>I don??t like commercial first aid kits. 90% of them are nothing but elaborate collections of different sizes of Band-Aids, with maybe a Motrin packet thrown in. It??s more of a ??minor inconvenience kit,?? which, y??know, has its place and all, but is more of a comfort measure than a safety precaution.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Here??s what I (two years as an EMT, three as an ER technician, but speaking <em>very unofficially and non-expertly</em> here) want to put in my first aid kit.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>??
</p>
<p class='vspace'>1. <strong>A CPR mask.</strong> Giving rescue breaths can be a nasty, barfy, germy business, and also a potentially lifesaving one. Attached to the mask: a card with ??30 COMPRESSIONS, 2 BREATHS, PUSH HARD, PUSH FAST?? printed on it in very large type.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>2.<strong> Several pairs of nitrile gloves.</strong> For the safety of both rescuer and victim. Latex is probably fine too, but some people are allergic to it. Some <strong>Handi-Wipes and hand sanitizer</strong> would be nice too, because even with gloves on you should still have clean hands. (Handi-Wipes can also be useful for preserving dignity in certain potty-related emergencies.)
</p>
<p class='vspace'>3. <strong>A bunch of 4x4 gauze squares, a wide roll of gauze, an ABD pad, and bandage tape.</strong> Because the wounds that <em>really</em> need bandaging aren??t going to be covered by a Band-Aid.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>4. <strong>Packets of Neosporin (or generic equivalent)</strong>. Neosporin is great for preventing infection in minor wounds. We use gobs of the stuff in the ER. See below for why you should <em>not</em> use alcohol or any other disinfectants.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>5. <strong>A couple Ace bandages.</strong> Ace bandage wraps can help all kinds of muscle, joint, and bone problems, from ??a little achy?? to ??completely broken.?? Don??t use the little metal connector things, just hold them in place with the same tape from your wound kit. If a bone is broken, you can improvise a splint from whatever??sticks, boards, cardboard, pillows??and hold it in place with the Ace wraps and tape.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>6. <strong>An instant cold pack.</strong> Keeps swelling down and reduces pain in muscle, joint, and bone injuries.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>7. <strong>EMT shears.</strong> They cut clothes off (ever try taking tight jeans off someone with a broken ankle?), cut through seatbelts, cut through rope, and make your little gauze squares the right size if you??re feeling fancy. Blunt-tipped and angled so they can cut right next to skin without hurting it. I &lt;3 my EMT shears.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>8.<strong> A clean, wrapped pair of tweezers.</strong> For splinters and beestings. They don??t have to be sterile or anything, but put them in a bag or keep them in the package or something. It??s nasty when they??re just bouncing around loose.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>9. <strong>A space blanket.</strong> People who are in shock need to be kept warm. Plus people who are just ordinary cold.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>10. <strong>Extra emergency medications</strong> specific to your family/group. Things like an inhaler for someone with asthma, an epi-pen for someone with severe allergies, or glucose tabs for someone with diabetes. If you do this, you <em>must</em> write the expiration dates on your calendar. Don??t <em>ever</em> give expired meds??they can be chemically degraded into something dangerous.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>11. <strong>A bottle of sterile water or saline.</strong> For washing out eyes and rinsing off wounds.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>12. <strong>A flashlight and batteries.</strong> How??re you going to save lives in the dark?
</p>
<p class='vspace'>13. <strong>A first aid instruction book</strong>, preferably a small and recent one. Add in notes about how to use any medications that are in the kit, and copy down their expiration dates.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>14. <strong>Medical information</strong> on any members of your family/group who take medication, have chronic conditions, or have allergies. Plus phone numbers of doctors and emergency contacts. (Not knowing what meds someone takes causes huge headaches in the ER. We don??t ??have it on file??; we can give the safest and best care if you give us a current med list, preferably with the doses and the times the person takes them.)
</p>
<p class='vspace'>15. <strong>A charged cellphone.</strong> This isn??t really an item to put in a first-aid kit, but it??s a safety measure to keep one on you, because calling 911 is <em>way</em> more important in a real emergency than knowing how to make a fancy bandage.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>16. <strong>Okay, a few Band-Aids. Fine. Be that way.</strong> Although they aren??t a matter of life and death, Band-Aids are nice for keeping cuts clean, protecting blisters, and making children feel like their owie is all better. So you can have a few. Just don??t fill a box completely with Band-Aids and call it an all-purpose first aid kit.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Whatever container you use for your kit, sort everything nicely with little dividers or separate pouches so you can grab what you need without feeling like you??re digging through your grandma??s purse.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><strong>??</strong>
</p>
<p class='vspace'><strong>Things NOT to put in a first aid kit: </strong>
</p>
<p class='vspace'>1. <strong>Any medications</strong> besides up-to-date emergency medications for specific people. Giving medication is usually not necessary first aid, can be illegal, and can be dangerous. (Okay, some Motrin and Benadryl for family use probably won??t kill you. But I really don??t recommend any medications.) Plus, first aid kits tend to sit in drawers for years at a go, people don??t really check all the expiration dates, and expired medications are ineffective and dangerous.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>2. <strong>Alcohol, iodine, or hydrogen peroxide.</strong> All these destroy tissue and delay healing when you put them in a fresh wound. Don??t use them in first aid.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>3. <strong>Smelling salts.</strong> Useless. Either a person will wake up quickly after you lay them down and raise their legs and say ??hey, wake up,?? or they??ve got a problem smelling salts can??t fix.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>4. <strong>Any kind of cutting implement.</strong> No razors, no scalpels, no sharp-tipped scissors. Any kind of amateur field surgery, no matter how minor, is a <em>very</em> bad idea.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>5. <strong>Tourniquets.</strong> The only injury that needs a tourniquet is a severed limb when you cannot stop the bleeding by any other means. Tourniquets are extremely dangerous and can turn minor injuries into amputations and deaths.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>6.<strong> Snake bite kits.</strong> Those suction-cuppy things are useless; you can??t ??suck out?? poison that??s in your bloodstream. Fortunately, the vast majority of snakebites are non-lethal anyway.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>7. <strong>Syrup of ipecac.</strong> Useless and dangerous. It tends to leave lots of poison still inside the person, but make them vomit so badly they can??t swallow any other medication. It can also dehydrate people and cause esophageal damage.

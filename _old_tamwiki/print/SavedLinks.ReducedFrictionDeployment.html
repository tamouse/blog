<p class='vspace'>I view my job as shepherding code from its inception in a Vim buffer, in a terminal session, in my development environment, until it makes it up into production in our space-age cloud app architecture. Anything less than that will result in mistakes, missed deadlines, and unfulfilled promises. It will also create unnecessary friction.

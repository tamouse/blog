<h2>Making requests for what you want</h2>
<p><a name='excerpt' id='excerpt'></a>
In order to get the things you want, often you have to request things of someone. This can also be used for self-directed actions, i.e., you are making requests of yourself.
<a name='excerptend' id='excerptend'></a>
</p>
<p class='vspace'><strong>Presupposition:</strong> both parties are willing to negotiate to a consensus.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><strong>Presupposition:</strong> the intention of both parties is to produce (realize) the outcome.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><strong>Presupposition:</strong> all behavior is the result of an initial good intention from the point of view of actor.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>An <strong>outcome</strong> is often divided into two parts: a <strong>request</strong> and a <strong>commitment</strong> are two halves of a whole <strong>Conversation For Action</strong> (a concept put forth by Terry Winograd of Stanford University). The purpose of the conversation is to have a person make a request of another person, the second person commit (or promise) to fulfill the request.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><ul><li>a <strong>request</strong> is in the form of a question
</li><li>a <strong>commitment</strong> is in the form of an assertion
</li></ul><div class='vspace'></div><h2>Canonical Request Form:</h2>
<div class='indent'>"I request that you perform <em>X</em> delivering <em>Y</em> by time <em>T</em>"
</div><div class='vspace'></div><h2>Canonical Response Forms:</h2>
<p>One of:
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><ol><li>"I accept."
</li><li>"I decline."
</li><li>A counteroffer to negotiate the specifications of <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>, and <em>T</em>. "I can't do <em>X</em> but I can do <em>X&#39;</em>, by date <em>T&#39;</em>. Is that ok?"
</li><li>A commitment to a future commitment ("I can't tell you now, but I'll get back to you about it on <em>date</em>."
</li></ol><p class='vspace'>All requests require a response; there is no such thing as silence equals agreement. The opposite is the case: if no response is made, the requestor should consider the request declined.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The <a class='wikilink' href='http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Consulting.WellFormedOutcomes?action=print'>well-formedness of the outcome / request / commitment</a> is the result of the full and independent commitment of both parties agreeing to and having, or being able to aquire, the resources, skills and knowledge to achieve the outcome / request / commitment. Each party is completely and independently responsible for the <a class='wikilink' href='http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Consulting.WellFormedOutcomes?action=print'>well-formedness</a> of the outcome / request / commitment.

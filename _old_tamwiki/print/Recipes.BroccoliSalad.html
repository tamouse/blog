<p class='vspace'>This recipe is pretty similar to <span class='wikiword'><a class='wikilink' href='http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Recipes.CauliflowerSalad?action=print'>CauliflowerSalad</a></span>, but has a flair all it's own as well. This has always been a big hit at potlucks and barbeques, often being specially requested.

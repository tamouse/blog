<p class='vspace'>The Internal Revenue Service strongly urges you to file your tax return
electronically.  It is the goal of the IRS to have more than 80% of taxpayers use an
electronic means in which to file.  The error rates are lower and your return and
refund are processed much faster.  Consider the following Internet sites to help you
with your tax return this year.

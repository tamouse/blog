Brought to you by the Innovation Network<br />
<br />
We had so many great responses to the request for questions to stimulate<br />
creativity that we're going to send them in batches. &nbsp;Here's the first<br />

I don't have five. &nbsp;I have 2 which work well for me.<br />
1 If there were no time or money limitations what would you do?<br />
2 When people tell me they don't know what to do, I ask<br />
&quot;If you knew what to do, what would it be?&quot;<br />
<br />

Two of my favorites:<br />
1 What do you want that you don't have now?<br />
2 What, if it were invented tomorrow, would put you out of business?<br />

Starting from Kipling's What/When/Why/Where/Who/(How):<br />
1 What have you done today that you have never done before?<br />
2 When are you next going to do something different?<br />
3 Why are you not doing or thinking something different '''right now'''?<br />
4 Where are you going on your holidays? (go somewhere '''different''')<br />
5 Who have you helped think differently today?<br />
6 How can you become even more creative?<br />
<br />
(I know you said 5, but I decided to break the rule!)<br />

<br />
* These three questions, in their specific form only came to me late<br />
&nbsp; in my 35 year engineering career in the Space business. How I wish<br />
&nbsp; they had been trained into from early on, and continuously<br />
&nbsp; thereafter.<br />
<br />
1. Give me five different ways that this (device, item, item) can be &quot;broken&quot;.<br />
<br />
Not only will one become more intimately acquainted with the &quot;item&quot; than<br />
they have ever been before, they will now be faced with the challenges to<br />
to exercise their &quot;creativity&quot; coming up with ways to re-design the &quot;item&quot;<br />
to keep it from being broken in ways they have never thought of before.<br />
(Note: &nbsp;I only heard this challenge stated openly as I reached the end of<br />
my career in the Space business. &nbsp;We, collectively were doing this, though<br />
not with the conscious intent of discovering ways to break an item. &nbsp;We<br />
did test items extensively to see if they would perform within the<br />
boundaries of a set of specifications as contrasted to looking for ways<br />
the item could be broken by 'surprise or the unexpected source&quot;.)<br />
<br />
2 &nbsp;&quot;Now that you have your (problem statement, mission statement, etc)<br />
give me ten 'assumptions' implicit in the (problem statement, mission<br />
statement, etc).&quot;<br />
<br />
3 &nbsp;Create a five or ten minute &quot;lesson plan&quot;, and present it, &nbsp;on how you<br />
would teach this concept to&quot; a grade school class and a high school class.<br />
(Note: I have been asked this and I did it. &nbsp;It was a memorable<br />
experience. I profited greatly from this experience.)<br />

1 How do YOU think we should do this?<br />
2 What would make this work more fun AND faster?<br />
3 If you had my job, what would you do differently?<br />
4 How would YOU recommend we improve quality?<br />
5 If this were &quot;the last minute&quot; would you do this assignment<br />
differently?<br />
<br />

I am really curious to see the answers.<br />
My suggestions:<br />
1 &quot;In how many ways can we ....&quot;. The classic brainstorm question.<br />
2 &quot;This is a really difficult problem and I am sure many other<br />
organizations have to deal with it. Can you address this problem?&quot; In<br />
this way you instantly rise above the case itself, suggesting looking for<br />
references, (improving on) proven methods, and a recognition that the<br />
work to be done is not trivial.<br />
3 &quot;... Solve this problem. Forever.&quot; Now it's obvious somebody wants this<br />
solved very badly. And you give every freedom to do it.<br />

Two of my favorite questions to get people thinking about thinking...<br />
1 What's something you don't know?<br />
2 What's a thought you've never thought before?<br />
<br />
<span class="sc0"><span class="kw3">From</span><span class="sy0">:</span> Mark Smith <span class="sy0">&lt;</span><span class="re2">marks@NOSPAMmsi-uk.com</span><span class="sy0">&gt;</span></span><br />
Tony Robbins poses some powerful questions which can help ignite<br />
<span class="sc0">creativity<span class="sy0">:</span></span><br />
<span class="sc0">1 <span class="st0">&quot;What is great about this problem?&quot;</span></span><br />
1 &quot;How can I use this (situation, challenge etc) to improve ...?&quot;<br />
<br />
My favourite is:<br />
1 &quot;What would I do, if I knew I couldn't fail?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Here are some questions I might ask my staff if I were trying to inspire<br />
them to be more creative:<br />
<br />
* What might we do that would create &quot;buzz value&quot; among our customers<br />
and competitors?<br />
* How would Disney approach this challenge?<br />
* How many other ways could we think about this?<br />
* What might we do if money, time, and politics were no object?<br />
* How many ways can you think of to reframe the challenge?<br />
* What outcome would you be really proud of at the end of this<br />
project?<br />
* What outcome might create an audible &quot;WOW&quot; in the organization?<br />
<br />
<span class="sc0"><span class="kw3">From</span><span class="sy0">:</span> Vanda North <span class="sy0">&lt;</span><span class="re2">VANDANORTH@NOSPAMcompuserve.com</span><span class="sy0">&gt;</span></span><br />
The questions I would ask are:<br />
1 &quot;What do you need to make &nbsp;(X) it happen?&quot;<br />
2 &quot;There are limitless resourses, now, what will you do?&quot;<br />
3 &quot;If you were Leonardo da Vinci, how would you manage it?&quot;<br />
4 &quot;They say this is impossible, and that we certainly can not do<br />
it.................??!!&quot;<br />
5 &quot;Go where-ever you relax best, and see what pops into your<br />
mind?!&quot;<br />
<br />
<span class="sc0"><span class="kw3">From</span><span class="sy0">:</span> Bob Barlow <span class="sy0">&lt;</span><span class="re2">rbarlow@NOSPAMfrontiernet.net</span><span class="sy0">&gt;</span></span><br />
In the introduction to my book, Bob Barlow's Book of Brain Boosters<br />
(Scholastic), I thank my late father for posing the question that sparked<br />
my lifelong love of creativity. I was about five years old when he looked<br />
me in the eye and asked, &quot;Bob, how do you throw away a garbage can?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dad wasn't looking for an answer, of course; there is no &quot;right&quot; answer.<br />
He just wanted to get me thinking -- which he did -- and that has made<br />
all the difference. Bob Barlow, sixth grade teacher.<br />

<span class="sc0"><span class="kw3">From</span><span class="sy0">:</span> Anne Robinson <span class="sy0">&lt;</span><span class="re2">anniecreate@NOSPAMhotmail.com</span><span class="sy0">&gt;</span></span><br />
Five possible questions which would get me going. &nbsp;Might<br />
not others.<br />
* If you could make any change you want in your current situation or<br />
assignment what would it be?<br />
* What setting would be most inspirational for you if you were asked<br />
for a really creative idea?<br />
* How would you remove worry and fear of failure from your mind and<br />
replace them with what William Miller calls &quot;a flash of brillilance&quot;?<br />
* How can you stretch your mind without leaving your brain hanging in<br />
long gray loops?<br />
* What gift would you seek from seven specific geniuses to enhance<br />
your own creative powers?<br />
<br />

Here are some questions that have proved useful to me in the past (my<br />
career was in Industrial Innovation).<br />
1 How else might we solve this problem or take advantage of this<br />
opportunity?<br />
2 How else might we define the problem/opportunity we face?<br />
3 How can we polish this &quot;diamond in the rough&quot;?<br />
4 How would you describe the feelings of &quot;aha&quot; that you have<br />
experienced?<br />
5 Who else can help us with our problem?<br />
<br />
<span class="sc0"><span class="kw3">From</span><span class="sy0">:</span> Dale M. Parish <span class="sy0">&lt;</span><span class="re2">IE_DMP@nospamHAL.LAMAR.EDU</span><span class="sy0">&gt;</span></span><br />
1 What is it that '''I''' (manager) do that I can stop doing that would<br />
help you feel less restricted.<br />
2 What is it about the work environment here that you believe keeps<br />
people from offering their suggestions.<br />
3 What can we do together to take the limits away for solving<br />
this/these problem(s).<br />
4 Whom in this department do you feel is the least receptive to change<br />
that could be moved to a position where they could be happy in doing<br />
non-creative work?<br />
5 What structure can I create as department manager to make the others<br />
in this department really believe that their most outlandish suggestions<br />
would be given a fair shake?<br />

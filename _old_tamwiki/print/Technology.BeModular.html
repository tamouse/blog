<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a name='excerpt' id='excerpt'></a>
Good software design calls for clean, well-though-out functions. Keeping functions and procedures small and modular aids several aspects of a good programming practice.

<div class='vspace'></div><h2>The Issue</h2>
<p>I've seen some horrendous code that went on for pages and pages. I
once worked on maintaining a piece of code that had one module that
covered 15 pages. You just couldn't keep track of where the various
parts began and ended. 
</p>
<p class='vspace'>One of the two main issues with non-modular code is that it is a night-mare to maintain if you can't find anything, and you can't reuse things you've already written without doing a copypasta, and <em>then</em> you have to maintain them in multiple places.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>The Solution</h2>
<p><strong>Modular programming</strong> to the rescue! In modular programming, you write
short, single-purpose functions and methods that can sit comfortably
on a page or a screenful. You don't have to scroll for ages to find
the top or the bottom of a loop, nor is your nesting so awful that you
can't keep track of braces (or whatever is supposed to delimit blocks
in the language of your choice).
</p>
<p class='vspace'>As I wrote <a class='wikilink' href='http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Technology.WriteFunctionsInASeparateInclude?action=print'>elsewhere</a> code reused
is a great way to improve your development time. Writing more modular,
single-functional code is a great way to begin to build a reusable
library of components. 
</p>
<p class='vspace'>There are basically two ways to approach modular design:

    class='createlink' href='http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Technology.BottomUpDesign?action=edit'>?</a>. You
should employ both, in actuality, and take opportunities to

reusable.

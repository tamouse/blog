<p class='vspace'>This is surprisingly simple and so delicious! I first had baked nachos from a little hole-in-the-wall burrito place in Santa Clara, whose name escapes me now. They had great burritos though, and this was what they made of nachos!
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul><li>8 oz restaurant-style tortilla chips (Mission, Tostitos, etc)
</li><li>2 oz cheddar cheese, grated
</li><li>2 oz pepper jack cheese, grated
</li><li>4 oz ground beef
</li><li>taco or fajita seasoning
</li><li>1/2 small onion, chopped
</li><li>1/2 cup salsa (to your taste) (or use pico de gallo)
</li><li>guacamole
</li><li>sour cream
</li></ul><div class='vspace'></div><h2>Directions</h2>
<ol><li>Pre-heat oven to 350&#x2109;.
</li><li>Brown the ground beef with the onions and the seasoning mix well. Drain.
</li><li>Place a doule layer of foil on a cooking tray, curling up the edges of the foil to form a leak barrier
</li><li>Spread the chips on the foil
</li><li>Layer the ground beef mixture onto the chips, spreading out so it covers well
</li><li>Layer the cheese on the beef and chips
</li><li>Place salsa around at various spots (you don't want to use too much or cover too heavily)
</li><li>Place in oven and bake for 15-20 minutes -- be careful not to let the chips burn!
</li><li>Serve with sour cream and guacamole for garnish'
</li></ol><div class='vspace'></div><h2>Variations</h2>
<ul><li>See <span class='wikiword'><a class='wikilink' href='http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Recipes.SimpleNachos?action=print'>SimpleNachos</a></span> for a quickie version -- not as good, but ok for quick nacho emergencies!
</li><li>If you like jalape??os, feel free. Even better would be to go all the way to roasted jalape??os, aka chipolte.
</li><li>You can put in practically any sort of meat, seasoned properly: chicken (pollo), steak (carne asada), pork (carnitas). Or even leave out the meat entirely, cheese nachos bake up really well!

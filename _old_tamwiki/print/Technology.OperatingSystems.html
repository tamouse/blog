<p class='vspace'>I use and have used many different operating systems over the years. Currently I use mostly Unix-based OSen: OS/X, Linux, BSD, Android. I feel extremely comfortable with these types of operating systems. I have used Windows as an end user, but have never written any applications for Windows beyond a few I wrote way back in Windows 3.1 and 3.11 days. These days, most of my work is in <a class='createlinktext' rel='nofollow'

<p class='vspace'><strong>&ldquo;If you surrender completely to the moments as they pass, you live more richly those moments.&rdquo; ~Anne Morrow Lindbergh</strong>
</p>
<p class='vspace'>There was a time when I was full of angst, and desperate to unleash it.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Since I felt misunderstood in some of my relationships, I&rsquo;d fight battles I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t win and then only consider letting go after a mini emotional break down.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>I needed to tire myself out in order to surrender. I needed to fully defuse my distress to give myself some peace. Though I wouldn&rsquo;t have admitted it, I was addicted to that drama. It was only when I broke down that I felt any relief.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Most of the time, I carried my anguish in my body, like a thick layer of nerves right below the surface. I was a constantly bubbling volcano, eager to erupt.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>I no longer fight through life in this way, but there are times when I feel a pervasive sense of alarm, a low-level sense of nervousness that is lessened but not fully eliminated through meditation.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>It&rsquo;s usually when responsibilities and deadlines are piling up, and I worry that it won&rsquo;t all get done.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>But the thing is: It always does. And it&rsquo;s not usually because of worrying, over-analyzing, or any other type of stressful mental activity.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Things get done because I am capable&mdash;not because I fight to finish.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>What I&rsquo;ve learned is that surrender doesn&rsquo;t have to follow battle. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a side effect of exhausting ourselves in some way, mentally, physically, or emotionally.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Surrender is a choice to be easy, to nurture a sense of inner calm that can carry us through even the most difficult circumstances.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>It&rsquo;s choosing not create drama where it doesn&rsquo;t need to be, and realizing life doesn&rsquo;t have to feel like a series of conflicts and crises.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>It&rsquo;s letting go of the need for control and realizing that, whatever happens, we&rsquo;ll be okay.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>It&rsquo;s easier to say, &ldquo;Be easy,&rdquo; than it is to actually do it, ironically, because it takes effort to stop expelling so much effort&mdash;to refrain from spinning in circles in our heads and simply take life as it comes at us.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The good news is that we have countless opportunities to practice easing in the moment.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>It helps when we remember: Our power isn&rsquo;t in our ability to fight life. It&rsquo;s in recognizing when we don&rsquo;t have to struggle.

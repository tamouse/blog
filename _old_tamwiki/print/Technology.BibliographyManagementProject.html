Originally looked at an old Rails application, Citer, and tried to update it to the latest and greatest version of Rails. But that wasn't working out so great, and there were some real oddities in the code. So I decided to rewrite it from scratch. So far, it's working out okay. I've had to figure out a few things here and there, such as associations. The original author had them all screwed up, but I've got them sussed out now.
<a name='excerptend' id='excerptend'></a>
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The core data structure is the publication. Associated data structures are people, who can be authors or editors; organizations, and tags.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>I've got the core of the application up and running now -- I can add new publications to the data base. People, Organizations and Tags get saved, but I haven't got them all the way hooked in to where I can manage them and use them.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Also, there is <strong>no</strong> web design on this yet, it's just the bare bones files as rendered automatically by rails' generator. A lot of work still to be done, for sure. I hope to offer this on my home server sometime, but will have to be sure to add in protections to keep it from getting spammed.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Of course, once it's done, the fun of adding entries begins!
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The structure of the publication data set is based around BibTex, an old and venerated bibliography maintenance system. I plan on writing importers and exporters so I can keep things in line with other text management systems. I will also be supporting XML export, and possibly RSS feeds.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Other ideas:
</p><ul><li>cover art
</li><li>table of contents
</li><li>misc attachments
</li><li>import/export to GoodReads.com
</li><li>interface with wiki
</li><li>interface with twitter/facebook
</li></ul><p class='vspace'>Still lots of debugging and development to do
</p><ul><li>redo Organization, make it many to one (a publication has one organization, an organization has many publications)
</li><li>get authors, editors, and tags fully working
</li><li>write tests
</li><li>do some design - make it look pretty
</li><li>list pagination
</li><li>auto completion
</li><li>write rdoc

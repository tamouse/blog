<p class='vspace'>These creamy Middle Eastern-style potatoes are flavored with turmeric and use olive oil rather than butter. They are great alone, and for fillings in puff pastries. Amounts of salt, pepper, and other spices may be adjusted to taste.

<ul><li>I think I would substitute butter for the olive oil for this crowd -- I personally would much prefer the olive oil, but others would object. -- <a class='wikilink' href='http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Profiles.Tamara?action=print'>tamara</a> October 16, 2011, at 12:26 PM

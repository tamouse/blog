<p class='vspace'>Notes for 10/29/96, Tuesday. Our last day in Israel.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Free day today. Most people are going shopping. I'm not sure yet what I'm going to do. I would like to go see the scrolls; I also would like to have someone along with me.
</p>

<p class='vspace'>Gifts given: 
</p><ul><li>to John: a bowl, very pretty, that he fell in love with in Safed. Julie bought one just like it for Chuck.
</li><li>to Carol: microcaligraphy of the book of ruth, very pretty, and different from most of themicrocalligraphy we saw.
</li><li>to Gilla: a widow's mite (ancient Hebrew coin) set in a gold pendant of evil eye warding hand
</li><li>all of us: Certificates of Attestation as Jerusalem Pilgrims.
</li></ul><p class='vspace'>Very touching, ar feeings all around, Gilla was deeply moved by our gift, clearly not a very usual thing for her. She definitely appreciated us s a group, and Carol most especially.

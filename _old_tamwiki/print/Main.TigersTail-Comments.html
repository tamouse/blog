<p>Please don't EVER remove this story. I am also disabled and my cyber stalker has begun publishing cartoons mocking my disability and that I suffer from incontinence.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>He and a young man he mentors have threatened to kill me with a .50 caliber hollow point bullet to the brain.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>This person even claims that he is the originator of "Don't kick a Tiger in the ass if you don't have a plan for the teeth."
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Be careful, he might be here soon, and claim to have you arrested if you keep this posted.

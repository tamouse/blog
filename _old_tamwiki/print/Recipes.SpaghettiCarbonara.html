<p class='vspace'>Carbonara is typically done with bits of proscuitto and bacon and parmesean. This recipe serves 2 admirably.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul><li>1/8 lb bacon
</li><li>4 ounces dry spaghetti noodles
</li><li>1/4 lb prosciutto
</li><li>1 clove crushed garlic
</li><li>1 tablespoon butter
</li><li>1/4 cup parmesan cheese
</li><li>2 tablespoons chopped parsley
</li><li>2 beaten eggs
</li><li>(optional, and you won't find this in my carbonara) 8-10 ripe olives
</li><li>2 tablespoons pimento (also optional)
</li><li>salt and pepper to taste
</li></ul><div class='vspace'></div><h2>Directions</h2>
<ol><li>Fry up the bacon, drain/degrease, and crumble (this is easiest done by chopping the end off a package of bacon, and cutting it into chunks before frying; attend to the cooking bacon so it doesn't burn).
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li><a class='wikilink' href='http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Recipes.MakingPerfectPasta?action=print'>Start the pasta cooking</a>. (To cook bacon to the consistency desired takes longer than to get the pasta cooked.)
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Julienne the prosciutto and fry for a few minutes as well. (Easily done while pasta is cooking.)
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>When the pasta is done, combine all the ingredients and mix thoroughly.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Serve at once, do not let the eggs cook too much (like not at all!)
</li></ol><div class='vspace'></div><h2>Comments</h2>
<p>Spaghetti or vermicelli are long, thin pasta. Sometimes it's easier to deal with them if you break them into thirds before cooking them.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>I think useful additions to the spicing would be basil and possibly even a touch of peppermint, although way not traditional. I also think substituting olive oil for the butter would make this even more authentic.

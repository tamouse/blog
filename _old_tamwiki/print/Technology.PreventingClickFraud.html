There are still problems with this, GET data (which<br />
essentially only what a clicked link would produce if you<br />
leave Javascript out the equation - you can't rely on<br />
Javascript) shouldn't be used to trigger a change on the<br />
server (in your case a counter increment)<br />
<br />
I did something similar for a competition site a few years<br />
ago, and stupidly didn't think about this at the<br />
time. Someone ended up gaming the system by including an<br />
image with the clicked-through URL in the src attribute, and<br />
put that on their MySpace profile page, which had more than<br />
a few visitors. Each of those visitors browser attempted to<br />
grab that &quot;image&quot; which registered a click, and because of<br />
the number of unique visitors, the clicks were registered as<br />
genuine.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend using POST data for this reason, as it's a lot<br />
more difficult for people to game.<br />

I agree, POST data is indeed the way to go here. Personally,<br />
I would use a &quot;like&quot; image-like thing which is actually a<br />
button, using some clever javascript (personally I would use<br />
jquery for this) you can then POST data to the server based<br />
on the click. Then set a cookie which disables the button<br />
(and keeps it disabled on future visits). This should<br />
prevent average person from repeatedly clicking it. You<br />
could also log the person's IP adress and filter based on<br />
that aswell; combining various methods would be best in this<br />
case I think.<br />
<br />
To prevent the method which Ashley mentioned, using POST<br />
data isn't enough. You would want to guarantee that the link<br />
came from YOUR server instead of some different place.<br />
There are multiple ways to do this:<br />
<br />
- use a unique key as an argument in the POST which can only<br />
be &quot;clicked&quot; once. Register the key in a database before<br />
serving the page, and then unregister it once it has been<br />
served and clicked. Though if a person were to repeatedly<br />
open the page, your cache would be exhausted, and the method<br />
would become useless.<br />
<br />
- require a referrer address to come from your domain; also<br />
reasonably easily circumvented in this case<br />
<br />
- there are more, but it really depends on how much effort<br />
you want to put into preventing attacks and how much effort<br />
you expect others to put into attacking it. For example,<br />
large sites like youtube are sure to use extensive measures<br />
to prevent people from spam-clicking in any way. While sites<br />
that only cater to say 3 visitors a month don't require all<br />
that effort in the first place.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />

<br />
I'm assuming this is not a voting system, and the news items<br />
you're counting are sourced from your own site and, with all<br />
due respect to Ash, unlikely to be a target for false<br />
clicks. All you're really wanting to do is prevent the site<br />
from registering multiple hits from the same user in a short<br />
period of time.<br />
<br />
I would probably use memcached on the server-side to store<br />
short-term information about clicks. When a news item is<br />
loaded...<br />
<br />
1) Construct the memcache key:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;newsclick_&lt;article_id&gt;_&lt;ip_address&gt;&quot;.<br />
<br />
2) Fetch the key from memcache.<br />
<br />
3a) If it does not exist, log the hit.<br />
<br />
3b) If it does exist, compare time() with the value and only<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; log the hit if time() is greater.<br />
<br />
4) Store the key with a value of time() + 300 and an expiry<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;of the same value.<br />
<br />
This will prevent hits being logged for the same news item<br />
from the same IP address within 5 minutes of other hits.<br />
<br />
Other alternatives would be to use cookies (could get messy,<br />
and not very reliable since it requires the response from<br />
click 1 to be processed before click 2 gets started),<br />
Javascript (as suggested by tedd but without the token - it<br />
would work pretty well and would be a lot easier to<br />
implement than the above, but you sacrifice having full<br />
control over it).<br />
<br />
If I'm interpreting the requirement correctly my solution is<br />
almost certainly overkill, and a simple Javascript solution<br />
would be more than sufficient.<br />

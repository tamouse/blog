<p class='vspace'><a class='external' href='http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4423992.Paolo_Perrotta' target='_blank'>Paolo Perrotta</a>'s <a class='external' href='http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7183279.Metaprogramming_Ruby__Program_Like_the_Ruby_Pros' target='_blank'>Metaprogramming Ruby: Program Like the Ruby Pros</a> is a <em>tour de force</em> on Ruby's Object Model. The book goes into considerable depth on how it works, and presents many examples of manipulating the object model to good use. The format of first section of the book goes through a week of a pair of Ruby programmers as they try to fix and refactor an existing application, and how they use various metaprogramming "spells" (techniques, idioms, etc). The second section is a set of essays talking directly to the reader, rather than talking about people working on something. The third section is a set of appendecies that encapsulate the various concepts discussed in the first two sections.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>One of the very nice things I liked about the first section is the use of hand-drawn images to depict the concepts being discussed. Not only does this give a sense of "reality" to the descriptions, it also gave me a sense of the inherent mutability of the model. How easy to quickly erase and write a new segement of a drawing on a white board; the issue of "this is set in stone" is completely eradicated by this technique, which reinforces the flexible nature of Ruby's object model.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>While metaprogramming itself can be a touchy subject ("how much is too much?" "how do you test and maintain it?" "how do you convey what you're doing to someone picking up your code" and so on), it is such a useful thing to know. At the end, the author offers up the opinion that, in fact, metaprogramming is just programming, after all, with all the goodness and badness that can result from that if you don't pay attention to what you're doing, and more importantly, <em>why</em> you're doing it. 
</p>
<p class='vspace'>I <strong>very strongly</strong> recommend this book to Rubyists, and to others who want to discover how and why the language works as it does. Anyone coming to Ruby from another object-oriented language would do very well to pick up this book and read it thoroughly, completing the various quizzes in the first section <em>before</em> reading the proferred solutions, and experiment with these techniques.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Even if one never ends up using metaprogramming, the book provides <em>such</em> a great explanation of the object model, it is worth reading in depth.

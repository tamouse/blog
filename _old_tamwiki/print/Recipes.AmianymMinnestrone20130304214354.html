<p class='vspace'>For <a class='external' href='http://tamouse.dreamwidth.org/profile' target='_blank'><img src='http://www.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/user.png' alt='' /></a><a class='external' href='http://tamouse.dreamwidth.org/' target='_blank'><strong>tamouse</strong></a>. I can offer measurements if pressed but really, it's a soup; you can basically throw everything together and if you like the ratio of solids to broth to flavoursome things, you've got it right. <a class='external' href='http://auxiliatrix.dreamwidth.org/profile' target='_blank'><img src='http://www.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/user.png' alt='' /></a><a class='external' href='http://auxiliatrix.dreamwidth.org/' target='_blank'><strong>auxiliatrix</strong></a> can testify as to its deliciosity.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The first thing you need to do is cook some navy beans and kidney beans in a roughly equal ratio. You should get them mostly done, but still somewhat crunchy, as they'll cook further in the soup. I do them for 15 minutes in my pressure cooker. Or, you can use canned beans. 
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Then, you need to chop as much red or yellow onion as you want. You also need to peel carrots, quarter them, and chop those. You can add celery too, but I usually skip it because I don't use it up quickly. It also requires a good quantity of coarsely minced garlic; tonight I used a whole head. 
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Start frying the onion on low heat in a good quantity of oil. When it's gone soft, add the carrots and celery. When the onion is starting to brown slightly at the edges, add the garlic. 
</p>
<p class='vspace'>To that, add: 
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><ul><li>Beans 
</li><li>1 32-ounce can diced or stewed tomatoes 
</li><li>8 cups stock or equivalent amount of water + bouillon (note: it's best if you don't go for straight chicken stock; something with a darker, browned flavor is nice. This could mean a bit of beef stock or vegetable stock; tonight I used a mix of cheap gross chicken bouillon granules and the dregs of a jar of vegetable Better than Bouillon.) 
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Rosemary 
</li><li>Bay leaves 
</li><li>Crushed red pepper flakes 
</li><li>Salt 
</li></ul><p class='vspace'>Bring everything to a boil, reduce the heat, and cover (It should simmer gently.) Cook for, I dunno, 45 minutes? Or however long you think the carrots and the beans need. You can really let it go or rush through this stage and it's not really deleterious to the result. 
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Add green beans. Fresh is nicest, I always use frozen, and canned is mushy. You can also add a zucchini if you'd like. That will need to cook for about 20 minutes; it's best if the veggies stay a little bit crisp. Also add any combination of thyme, basil, and oregano. (Fresh herbs are awesome, of course.) Separately, boil salted water for pasta. I like medium shells. Leave the pasta chewy; it cooks more in the soup. You want to be more careful of your timing here; I feel like the veggies being crisp or not makes a big difference in the overall impression the finished soup makes. When your veggies and pasta are done, stop everything and add a good pile of black pepper. (Pepper gets bitter when it's cooked.) Om nom nom.

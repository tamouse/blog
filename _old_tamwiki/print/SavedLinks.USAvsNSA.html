<p>Welp looks like I'm going to have to do it, be back in like an hour or two.
</p><ul><li>Update: Pulling in an old model I did for a game a while back. Retrofitting it to work with the scene.
</li><li>Update2: Usa logo
</li><li>Update3: The camera + Stand
</li><li>Update4: Rigging all done, now for the time consuming part animation!
</li><li>Update5: About a third the way through all the keyframes, and looks like I am going to pull a backup. Not to worry, I got this.(Thanks for Gold, :D)
</li><li>Update6: Back in business, looks like we didn't lose much at all. :)
</li><li>Update7: Ate some homemade pizza. { Don't hate me, :P } But the good news is I was able to render a small rough draft preview for you while I ate. Keep in mind there is still a bit left to do, the timing such will be sorted out and fixed. I will keep at it until it's perfect.
</li><li>Update8: Getting closer, done with the keyframing and new materials. Soon it will be rendering time!
</li><li>Update9: Here we go final render time, grab a beer(assuming you're of age) and sit back we're in the home stretch. [This will take some time]
</li><li>Ughdate10: Render is being all slow. :/ I did set the samples a bit high, so it may take a little longer but it will look nicer. Right now its running at 27 seconds a frame, and it's more than halfway now.
</li><li>Update11: So close now, 60 more frames and I got it down to 18 seconds a frame. If you want something for the meantime I have a video on my(Unfinished) website, it has some behind the scenes stuff for animations like this. It's all I can do ATM, like watching paint dry. :)
</li><li>Update12: It's here! and the Gif
</li><li>Update13: Thanks everyone for all the amazing feedback, wouldn't have been able to keep going and pushing for it to be better if it wasn't for you. Here is a new alternate version a few have requested. Alternate Gif.

<p class='vspace'>When you need crumbled bacon or bacon bits, here is a good way I've found to handle them.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>If you need a 1/4 pound of bacon bits, instead of pealing off 4 slices, just cut a 1/4 of a pound of bacon off an end.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Chop up the chunk of bacon you've just hacked off into smaller pieces, about bite sized should do. Note: partially frozen bacon is much easier to cut than fully thawed bacon.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Cook these pieces over medium-high heat, keeping an eye on them, stirring them so they don't stick and burn, and pulling the pieces apart.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>When done, to crisp but not burnt stage, pull the pieces out with a straining spoon and place on paper towels to absorb the grease. You can further crumble the bacon from this stage if desired.

<p>Diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder Is Often Flawed
</p>
<p class='vspace'>True sufferers are often troubled&mdash;and yet time and treatment can often improve their lives
</p>

<p class='vspace'>This past June renowned clinical psychologist Marsha M. Linehan of the University of Washington made a striking admission. Known for her pioneering work on borderline personality disorder (BPD), a severe and intractable psychiatric condition, 68-year-old Linehan announced that as an adolescent, she had been hospitalized for BPD. Suicidal and self-destructive, the teenage Linehan had slashed her limbs repeatedly with knives and other sharp objects and banged her head violently against the hospital walls. The hospital&rsquo;s discharge summary in 1963 described her as &ldquo;one of the most disturbed patients in the hospital.&rdquo; Yet despite a second hospitalization, Linehan eventually improved and earned a Ph.D. from Chicago&rsquo;s Loyola University in 1971.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Many psychologists and psychiatrists were taken aback by Linehan&rsquo;s courageous admission, which received high-profile coverage in the New York Times. Part of their surprise almost surely stemmed from an uncomfortable truth: people with BPD are often regarded as hopeless individuals, destined to a life of emotional misery. They are also frequently viewed as so disturbed that they cannot possibly achieve success in everyday life. As a consequence, highly accomplished individuals such as Linehan do not fit the stereotypical mold of a former BPD sufferer. But as Linehan&rsquo;s case suggests, much of the intense pessimism and stigma surrounding this disorder are unjustified. Indeed, few psychological disorders are more mischaracterized or misunderstood.

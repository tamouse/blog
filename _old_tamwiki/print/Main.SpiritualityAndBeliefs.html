I don't espouse any particular religion or set of beliefs. I am most closely allied with atheism in that I have a hard time believing in supernatural things, or for their ability to affect things physically if they do exist, so they are largely irrelevant to me. There are things which I do think relate to spirituality and beliefs, however, which are important to me and possibly to others. I have derived great benefit from practices of meditation and some kinds of prayer. While I don't necessarily believe that my prayers actually affect anyone else directly, they do affect me, and in turn, I can affect others.

<p class='vspace'>Here are some things I've captured dealing with Sprirituality and Beliefs.

<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Prayers</h2>
<h3>Serenity Prayer, expanded</h3>
<p>God, Grant me:
</p><ul><li><strong>Clarity</strong>, amidst confusion
</li><li><strong>Hope</strong>, amidst despair
</li><li><strong>Faith</strong>, in the world and in myself
</li><li><strong>Serenity</strong> to accept that which I cannot change
</li><li><strong>Courage</strong> to change the things I can
</li><li>and the <strong>Wisdom</strong> to know the difference
</li></ul><div class='vspace'></div><h3>Serenity Prayer, <strong>revised</strong></h3>
<p>Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,<br />The courage to change the person I can<br />And the wisdom to know that person is <strong>me</strong>.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><hr />
<p class='vspace'>Bless them and change me!
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><hr />
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Morning Prayer</h3>
<p>I open my ears That I may hear the wisdom of my ancestors. 
<br  />I open my eyes that I may see with vision and clarity.  
<br  />I open my mouth that I may speak with gentle intelligence and compassion.  
<br  />I open my heart that I may love and be loved.  
<br  />I open my arms to receive the bountiful gifts of the [Universe].
<br  />Blessed be this day.

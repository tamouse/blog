</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div class='indent'><em>Always wash your hands after handling capsicum peppers; use detergent (better still, a non-toxic degreaser like Simple Green) because capsaicin is an oily alkaloid, and unless you particularly like running screaming for the shower, <strong>don't</strong> rub your eyes after handling capsicum peppers, especially any of the more potent varieties. (Be careful about handling other tender bits, too. You know what I mean.) Don't be ashamed to use latex or nitrile gloves.</em>
</div><p class='vspace'>This is great advice. I think anyone who's tried handling raw peppers has experienced this at least once -- like touching the stove -- and you learn to treat these things with respect. Using gloves is really good advice; people who handle these things all the time where much heavier rubber gloves than mentioned above. This is a time when you want to also be really careful about knife usage -- capsaicin in a cut also burns like hell and isn't readiliy washed out of a wound.

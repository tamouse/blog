<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Abstract:</h2>
<p>In the study reported here, we tested the novel sexualized-body-inversion hypothesis. Integrating research and theory on objectification and person versus object recognition, we examined whether sexualized women, but not sexualized men, are recognized in the same way as objects are. According to objectification theory (Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997), female bodies are scrutinized and evaluated to a greater degree than male bodies are, which leads to sexual objectification of women. Defined as viewing or treating an individual as a sexualized body, or as sexualized body parts, available for satisfying the needs and desires of other people (Bartky, 1990), sexual objectification has been recently operationalized by portraying the target wearing underwear or a swimsuit.

<p class='vspace'>Sexual objectification is related to decreased mind attribution (Loughnan et al., 2010), diminished agency perception (Cikara, Eberhardt, &amp; Fiske, 2010), and dehumanization (Vaes, Paladino, &amp; Puvia, 2011). Moreover, Heflick and Goldenberg (2009) have shown that focusing on targets?? appearance, rather than on their personality, could diminish the degree of human nature attributed to female targets but not to male targets (attribution of human nature is a critical dimension of social perception that allows people to differentiate humans from objects; Loughnan &amp; Haslam, 2007). Furthermore, sexual objectification generally has more adverse consequences for females than for males (Gervais, Vescio, &amp; Allen, 2011a; Moradi &amp; Huang, 2008; Saguy, Quinn, ??

I recently had a situation where I had some problems working with the navigation paths on my development system that was going into a different directory structure on my production machine. In this case, the development path was a few layers deep while the production path was at the DocumentRoot.
<a name='excerptend' id='excerptend'></a>
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The way I resolved the issue was to apply a couple of things:
</p><ol><li>create a virtual host that pointed to the development path
</li><li>update the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file to include names for the virtual host
</li></ol><div class='vspace'></div><h2>Setting up your server for using virtual hosts</h2>
<p>Most apache installations come out of the box ready to support virtual hosts. They just need to be configured.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><span class='notebox'> If you are going to set up your apache server for virtual hosting, one thing to keep in mind is that you must use a virtual host for the default host; the information in the <code>httpd.conf</code> file for ServerName and DocumentRoot is ignored.</span>
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Set up vhosts subdirectory</h3>
<p>If there isn't already, create a subdirectory to hold the various virtual host configuration files. This makes it easier to manage multiple virtual hosts without cluttering up the main <code>httpd.conf</code> file:
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><pre>          mkdir /etc/apache2/vhosts
</pre><p class='vspace'>is one example of how to do this.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Modify the <code>httpd.conf</code> file </h3>
<p>You will need to modify the <code>httpd.conf</code> file to use virtual hosts by adding the following lines:
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><pre>         ## Virtual hosts
         <span class='wikiword'>NameVirtualHost</span> *:80

         &lt;<span class='wikiword'>VirtualHost</span> *:80&gt;
         <span class='wikiword'>ServerName</span> localhost
         <span class='wikiword'>DocumentRoot</span> "/<span class='wikiword'>Library/WebServer</span>/Documents"
         &lt;/<span class='wikiword'>VirtualHost</span>&gt;

         Include /etc/apache2/vhosts/*.conf
</pre><p class='vspace'>The last line will include all file from the vhosts directory that end in <code>.conf</code>.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><span class='notebox'> on OS X, the path to <code>/etc</code> is really <code>/private/etc</code>.</span>
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Create the configuration file for your new vhost:</h3>
<pre>         cd /etc/apache2/vhosts
         touch mysite.conf
</pre><div class='vspace'></div><h3>Configure the <code>mysite</code> vhost:</h3>
<pre>         &lt;<span class='wikiword'>VirtualHost</span> *:80&gt;
         <span class='wikiword'>ServerName</span> mysite
         <span class='wikiword'>DocumentRoot</span> "/path/to/mysite/files"
         &lt;/<span class='wikiword'>VirtualHost</span>&gt;
</pre><div class='vspace'></div><h3>Make changes to <code>/etc/hosts</code></h3>
<p>In order for you to browse to the vhost to let your machine know where to find the vhost. Add the following line to <code>/etc/hosts</code>:
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><pre>         127.0.0.1    mysite
</pre><p class='vspace'><span class='notebox'> Note that the separator between the IP address and the hostname is a tab character.</span>
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Restart the server and you should be good to go!</h3>
<pre>        apachectl restart
</pre><p class='vspace'>You can now access the virtual host via the URL: <code class='escaped'>http://mysite/</code>.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div>

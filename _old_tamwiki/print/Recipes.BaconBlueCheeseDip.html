<p class='vspace'>Don't know where I found this recipe, but it makes a great dip. Someone tried on their burger at a BBQ and declared it wonderful.

<p class='vspace'><a name='ingredients' id='ingredients'></a>
</p><h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul><li>1/2 pound of bacon
</li><li>1 large onion, chopped (vidalia or walla-walla are best in this)
</li><li>3 large cloves garlic, minced
</li><li>1.5 cups light mayo or miracle whip
</li><li>8 ounces of crumbled blue cheese
</li><li>Ground black pepper to taste
</li></ul><p class='vspace'><a name='directions' id='directions'></a>
</p><h2>Directions</h2>
<ol><li>In a medium hot skillet, cook the bacon. <em>(The easiest way I've found to do this is cut up the uncooked bacon into 2 inch strips and keep a good eye on it while it's cooking. Bacon is one of those things that can go from underdone to overdone in a moment. See <a class='wikilink' href='http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Recipes.MakingBaconBits?action=print'>MakingBaconBits</a>)</em>
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Remove the bacon from the pan and drain on paper towels.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Add the onion and garlic to the bacon grease in the skillet and cook until the onion is translucent (or see <a href='#comment001'>first comment</a>). Drain and transfer to a bowl.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Crumble the bacon and add to the bowl. 
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Add the mayo, blue cheese and pepper; mix thoroughly.
</li></ol><p class='vspace'><a name='variations' id='variations'></a>
</p><h2>Variations</h2>
<p>This is one of those recipes you have to play around with quantities to get it to the consistency you'd like. More/less mayo, more/less blue cheese, etc. More bacon? You bet! Less bacon? NO WAY!
</p>
<p class='vspace'>I'm going to try this with carmelized onions sometime.

The recipe says to only cook the onions and garlic until
translucent. I think this recipe would be made awesomer and awesomer if you took the onions all the way to carmelized.

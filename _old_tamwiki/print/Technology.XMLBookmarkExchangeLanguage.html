</p>
<p class='vspace'>The XML Bookmark Exchange Language, or XBEL, is an Internet "bookmarks" interchange format. It was designed by the Python XML Special Interest Group on the group's mailing list.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The original intent was to create an interesting, fun project which was both useful and would demonstrate the Python XML processing software which was being developed at the time. Mark Hammond contributed the original idea, and other members of the SIG chimed in to add support for their favorite browser features. After debate which ranged far afield from the original idea, compromises were reached which allow XBEL to be a useful language for describing bookmark data for a range of browsers, including the major browsers and a number of less widely used browsers.

<p class='vspace'>Export Safari bookmarks to XBEL
<br  />Fri, Apr 9 '04 at 10:22AM ?? from: Anonymous

<p class='vspace'>For accessing my Safari Bookmarks while on the road, I have a little web application running which makes use of the ever more popular XBEL format. So <a class='external' href='http://simulakron.de/sabel.html' target='_blank'>here's my little Perl script</a> to convert Safari's Bookmarks into XBEL format. In addition, it offers to compile a description from the pages' contents (time intensive). 
</p>
<p class='vspace'>This is a hack from my prior <a class='external' href='http://simulakron.de/babybel.html' target='_blank'>Omniweb 2 XBEL Converter script</a>. Current drawback is a complete reversal of the order of the Bookmarks structure. I was too lazy to care. Hope it is as useful to someone as it is to me. Use at your own risk as usual.

<p class='vspace'>robg adds: I have also mirrored the script on the macosxhints' download site:

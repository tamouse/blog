</p><h2>Comments</h2>
<p>Everyone who reads this (and other recipes I use canned mushrooms in) says "I'd use real mushrooms." Well, yes, you certainly can. I might too if I remember to buy them and use them. Canned ones mean I don't have to worry about fresh ones going bad, or going to the store when I want to make this.

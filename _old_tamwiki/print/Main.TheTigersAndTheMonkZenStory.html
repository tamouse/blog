<p class='vspace'>This story is rather famous:
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div class='indent'>A man was walking across a field when he heard a rustling in the
tall grass beside him, and turned to see the hungry eyes of a large
tiger staring at him. The man began to run, fear giving him greater
speed and stamina than he knew he possessed. But always, just
behind him, he could hear the easy breathing of the hungry
tiger.
<div class='vspace'></div></div><div class='indent'>Finally, the man stopped, not because his strength had
failed but because he had come to the edge of a high cliff and
could go no further. "I can let the tiger eat me, or take my life
in my own hands and jump." The man turned and saw the tiger slowly
walking toward him, licking its mouth in anticipation. Resolved to
take his own life, the man stepped to the edge of the cliff and
bent his legs to jump, when he suddenly noticed a thick vine
growing out of the side of the cliff, several feet from the
top. 
<div class='vspace'></div></div><div class='indent'>Carefully, he let himself drop down the cliff face, catching
hold of the vine as he slid past, and being thankful when it was
strong enough to support his weight. 
<div class='vspace'></div></div><div class='indent'>Hanging now, the man looked up
and saw the tiger's eyes peering over the edge of the cliff. It
roared down at him, then began to pace back and forth along the top
of the cliff. 
<div class='vspace'></div></div><div class='indent'>For the first time, the man looked at the vine that
had saved his life. It was thick enough for him to wrap his legs
around, resting his arms, and long enough that he might be able to
let himself far enough down to jump safely to the ground below.
<div class='vspace'></div></div><div class='indent'>The moment he had this thought was the same moment that he saw the
second tiger, pacing back and forth at the foot of the cliff,
licking its mouth, and looking hungrily up at him. 
<div class='vspace'></div></div><div class='indent'>Well, thought
the man, if my strength and the strength of the vine are great
enough, perhaps I can outwait the tigers. Surely, they'll go
someplace else to eat when they're hungry enough.  
<div class='vspace'></div></div><div class='indent'>The man
settled in for a long wait. His preparations halted
quickly, however, when he heard a scurrying, scratching sound close
to his own face. 
<div class='vspace'></div></div><div class='indent'>Glancing upwards, he saw two mice, one white and
one black, emerge from a small hole in the cliff. They made their
way swiftly to the base of the vine, and began to gnaw through it
with their small sharp teeth. There was nothing else he could do, a
tiger above, a tiger below, and the vine that kept him from their
jaws about to break. 
<div class='vspace'></div></div><div class='indent'>He was closing his eyes to begin his
prayers, when he noticed, a little to his right, a tiny patch of
red color on the face of the cliff. He reached toward it
precariously, pulled, and brought his hand back beneath his
eyes. 
<div class='vspace'></div></div><div class='indent'>There, in his palm, was a luscious, red strawberry. The man
swiftly pressed the strawberry between his lips, onto his tongue,
and hanging between those still visible tigers, he enjoyed the
finest , juiciest, sweetest meal of his life.

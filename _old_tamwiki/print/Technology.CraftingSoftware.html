<p class='vspace'>What I do for my living is write software, aka, programming computers. I have been doing this for a long, long time! I wrote my first BASIC computer program when I was between 6th and 7th grades in summer school, using an old TTY33 teletype with punched paper tape, talking to an HP2000 BASIC OS computer that was at the school district office. This was exciting! I eventually wrote a lunar lander program that summer.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Since then, I've rather stuck with it. Although I began my university study in EE, by the 3rd year, I switched completely to CS as it was so much more fun!
</p>
<p class='vspace'>I've written in many <a class='wikilink' href='http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Technology.Languages?action=print'>Languages</a>, and done a whole lot of different things.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Over the course of these many years, I've learned quite a lot about the practice of programming, which I will attempt to share here some insights.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><a class='external' href='http://tamouse.org/2012/12/04/code-as-literature-software-dev-as-communication/' target='_blank'>Thoughts on the idea of software development craftsmanship</a> -- a blog post I wrote capturing a rambling monologue on irc on my thoughts about software development as a craft, and code as literature.

<p>Summary:This breakfast casserole topped with runny eggs by F&amp;W's Grace Parisi develops a terrific texture as it cooks slowly in a glass dish (which makes it easy to see when the bottom is perfectly browned). As one F&amp;W editor remarked on tasting it, "I worship the crisp bottom and the chewy, moist bread."

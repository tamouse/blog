<p>Summary: I recently described&nbsp;what remarkable bosses do. A number of people emailed and asked, &quot;That's a great list, but flip it around: What things should I&nbsp;not&nbsp;do?&quot; Glad you asked. As a leader what you don't do can sometimes make as much or even more impact than what you do.

<p class='vspace'>I recently described&nbsp;<a class='external' href='http://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/the-5-qualities-of-remarkable-bosses.html?nav=pop' target='_blank'>what remarkable bosses do</a>. A number of people emailed and asked, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great list, but flip it around: What things should I&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;do?&rdquo;
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Glad you asked.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>As a leader what you don&rsquo;t do can sometimes make as much or even more impact than what you do. Here are five things remarkable bosses&nbsp;<em>never</em>&nbsp;do:
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been meaning to apologize for a while&hellip;&rdquo;</h2>
<p>You should never need to apologize for not having apologized sooner.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>When you mess up, &lsquo;fess up. Right away. You certainly want employees to immediately tell you when they make a mistake, so model the same behavior.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>If love means never having to say you&rsquo;re sorry, leadership means always having to say you&rsquo;re sorry.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Deliver annual performance reviews.</h2>
<p>Annual or semi-annual performance appraisals are largely a waste of time.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Years ago my review was late so I mentioned it to my boss. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get to it&hellip; but you should know you won&rsquo;t hear anything new. You&rsquo;ve already heard everything I will say, good or bad. If anything on your review comes as a surprise to you I haven&rsquo;t done my job.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class='vspace'>He was right. The best feedback isn&rsquo;t scheduled. The&nbsp;<a class='external' href='http://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/the-9-elements-of-highly-effective-employee-praise.html' target='_blank'>best feedback</a>&nbsp;happens on the spot when it makes the most impact, either as praise and encouragement or as training and suggestions for improvement. Waiting for a scheduled review is the lazy way out.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Your job is to coach and mentor and develop&ndash;every day.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Hold formal meetings to solicit ideas.</h2>
<p>Many companies hold brainstorming sessions to solicit ideas for improvement, especially when times get tough.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Sounds great; after all you&rsquo;re &ldquo;engaging employees&rdquo; and &ldquo;valuing their contributions,&rdquo; right? But you don&rsquo;t need a meeting to get input. When employees know you listen they bring ideas to you.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>And if you must ask, the better way to ask for ideas is to talk to people individually and to be more specific. Say, &ldquo;I wish we could find a way to get orders through our system faster. What would you change if you were me?&rdquo;
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Trust me: Employees picture themselves doing your job&ndash;and doing your job better than you&ndash;all the time. They have ideas. Sometimes they have great ideas. Be open, act on good ideas, explain why less than good ideas aren&rsquo;t feasible&hellip; and you&rsquo;ll get all the input you can handle without a formal meeting.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Create development plans.</h2>
<p>Formal development plans are, like annual performance reviews, largely a corporate construct. You should know what each of your employees hopes to achieve: Skills and experience they want to gain, career paths they hope to take, etc.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>So talk about it&ndash;informally. Then assign projects that fit. Provide training that fits. Create opportunities that fit.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Then give feedback on the spot. &ldquo;Develop&rdquo; is a verb. To develop requires action. &ldquo;Development&rdquo; is a noun that sits in a file cabinet.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Call in favors.</h2>
<p>I know lots of bosses who play the guilt game, like saying, &ldquo;Mark, I was really flexible with your schedule while your son was sick&hellip; now I really need you to come through for me and work this weekend.&rdquo;
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Generosity should always be a one-way street. Be flexible when being flexible is the right thing to do. Be accommodating when being accommodating is the right thing to do.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Never lend money to friends unless you don&rsquo;t care if you are repaid, and never do &ldquo;favors&rdquo; for employees in anticipation of return.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Remarkable leaders only give. They never take.

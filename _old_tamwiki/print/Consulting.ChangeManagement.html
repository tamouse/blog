<p class='vspace'><strong>Change Management</strong>, or <strong>Managing Organizational Change</strong>, deals with the issues surrounding changes in organizations, whether to install a new tool or process, to a reorganization, to a downsizing. It covers the gammut of how changes affect individuals in organizations, and how to swiftly and (relatively) easily move an organization through a change to a positive, working, desired future state.

<p class='vspace'>Change Management is one of the areas I consult in a lot, and it is part of every consulting effort I've ever encountered. Humans, as a lot, are averse to changes imposed upon them.

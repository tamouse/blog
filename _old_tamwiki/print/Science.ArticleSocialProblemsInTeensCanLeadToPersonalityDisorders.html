</p>
<p class='vspace'>A new research study looks at how adolescents think, how disordered thinking can take root, and how this thought pattern can ultimately lead to an adult personality disorder.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The study examines the relationship between borderline personality disorder (BPD) traits and "hypermentalizing" in adolescents. Mentalizing is the social intelligence that refers to the ability to infer and attribute thoughts and feelings to understand and predict another person's behavior.

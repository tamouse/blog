<h2>Well-Formed Outcomes</h2>
<p><a name='excerpt' id='excerpt'></a>
In building a <span class='wikiword'><a class='wikilink' href='http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Consulting.DesiredState?action=print'>DesiredState</a></span>, the quality of the description of the outcomes is important to being able to achieve them.

<p class='vspace'><strong>Assertion:</strong> quality of life is dependent upon achieving one's outcomes in life.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><strong>Assertion:</strong> the quality (value to the person requesting something) of one's outcomes is in direct proportion to the <em>well-formedness</em> of the outcome.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Outcomes have the following properties. All of these are necessary in order to make the outcome well-formed.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><dl><dt>Specificity</dt><dd>precisely stated action to be performed and result desired from the action. Specific as to outcome, form, place, time, cost, value, person(s):
<dl><dt>outcome</dt><dd>what is the desired result from the action? The outcome itself must be stated. A complete picture of the <span class='wikiword'><a class='wikilink' href='http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Consulting.DesiredState?action=print'>DesiredState</a></span> of the requestor is most useful.
</dd><dt>form</dt><dd>what form will the result be needed in?
</dd><dt>place</dt><dd>where will the action be performed and where will the result be delivered?
</dd><dt>time</dt><dd>when is the result needed and how much time can the action take?
</dd><dt>cost</dt><dd>what is the budget for carrying out the action and the cost of materials for the result?
</dd><dt>value</dt><dd>how will the person performing the commitment be compensated and how will the requestor be using the result in future work?
</dd><dt>person</dt><dd>who is making the request, the commitment response, carrying out the action, delivering the result, receiving the result, and using the result?
</dd></dl><div class='vspace'></div></dd><dt>Obtainability</dt><dd>the result must be able to be achieved by the person(s) within the specifications made.
<div class='vspace'></div></dd><dt>Positive</dt><dd>the commitment is for what is wanted, not what is not wanted. There are no statements of the form "Don't do ..." or "I don't want...". A positive outcome is easier and richer to specify than the list of things it isn't supposed to be.
<div class='vspace'></div></dd><dt>Appropriate chunk size</dt><dd>the result requested can be negotiated in a single setting. The requestor must be able to use the result delivered
<div class='vspace'></div></dd><dt>Ecological</dt><dd>the outcome is not harmful to any of those involved, and furthers the goals and needs of the requestor.

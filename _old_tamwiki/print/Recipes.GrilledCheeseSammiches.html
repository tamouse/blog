Grilled cheese sammiches are the traditional midwestern comfort food. Paired with tomato soup, they are wonderful for when things are cold and blowy, or when you don't want to think about what to make.

<div class='footnote'>&nbsp;</div><p class='footnote'><a name='fn1_1' id='fn1_1'></a><sup>1</sup> The heat of the griddle/pan will depend on how long you grill for -- don't set the heat too high as it is much more likely to end up with charred bread and solid insides. Lower heat is more easily managed. <a href='#fnr1_1'>&uArr;</a></p><p class='footnote'><a name='fn1_2' id='fn1_2'></a><sup>2</sup> If you have a sandwich/panini grill, or one of those George Foreman Grills, they can make doing grilled cheese really easy, grilling both sided of the sandwich at the same time, and smooshing it a bit to give some extra tooth. <a href='#fnr1_2'>&uArr;</a></p>

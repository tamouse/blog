<p class='vspace'>Stand still. The trees ahead and bushes beside you
<br  />Are not lost. Wherever you are is called Here,
<br  />And you must treat it as a powerful stranger,
<br  />Must ask permission to know it and be known.
<br  />The forest breathes. Listen. It answers,
<br  />I have made this place around you,
<br  />If you leave it you may come back again, saying Here.
<br  />No two trees are the same to Raven.
<br  />No two branches are the same to Wren.
<br  />If what a tree or a bush does is lost on you,
<br  />You are surely lost. Stand still. The forest knows
<br  />Where you are. You must let it find you.

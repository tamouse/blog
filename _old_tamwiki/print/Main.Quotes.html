<p>Control is an illusion. Giving in to chaos is the only way through. You don't surf by telling the waves what to do.

<div class='round lrindent quote' > 
<p>??The world is rated R, and no one is checking <span class='wikiword'>IDs</span>. Do not try to make it G by imagining the shadows away. Do not try to hide your children from the world forever, but do not try to pretend there is no danger. Train them. Give them sharp eyes and bellies full of laughter. Make them dangerous. Make them yeast, and when they??ve grown, they will pollute the shadows.??

<div class='vspace'></div><h3>What is the most astounding fact you can share with us about the Universe?</h3>
<p>The most astounding fact is the knowledge that the atoms that comprise life on Earth, the atoms that make up the human body, are traceable to the crucibles that cooked light elements into heavy elements in their core under extreme temperatures and pressures. These stars, the high mass ones among them went unstable in their later years. They collapsed and then exploded scattering their enriched guts across the galaxy; guts made of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and all the fundamental ingredients of life itself. These ingredients become part of gas clouds that condense, collapse, form the next generation of solar systems stars with orbiting planets, and those planets now have the ingredients for life itself. 
</p>
<p class='vspace'>So that when I look up at the night sky and I know that yes, we are part of this universe, we are in this universe, but perhaps more important than both of those facts is that <strong>the Universe is in us</strong>. When I reflect on that fact, I look up &ndash; many people feel small because they&rsquo;re small and the Universe is big &ndash; but I feel big, because my atoms came from those stars. There&rsquo;s a level of connectivity. That&rsquo;s really what you want in life, you want to feel connected, you want to feel relevant; you want to feel like a participant in the goings on of activities and events around you.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>And that&rsquo;s precisely what we are, just by being alive.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div class='indent'>&mdash; Neil <span class='wikiword'>DeGrasse</span> Tyson, Ph.D., Astrophysicist, this generation's best science communicator and proponent, this generation's Carl Sagan.

<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Nothing "mere" about science [Feynman]</h2>
<p><a name='feynman01' id='feynman01'></a>
Poets say science takes away from the beauty of the stars&mdash; mere globs of gas atoms. Nothing is &lsquo;mere&rsquo;. I too can see the stars on a desert night, and feel them. But do I see less or more? The vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination&mdash; stuck on this carousel my little eye can catch one-million-year-old light. A vast pattern&mdash; of which I am a part&hellip; What is the pattern or the meaning or the why? It does not do harm to the mystery to know a little more about it. For far more marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past imagined it. Why do the poets of the present not speak of it? What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were a man, but if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent.
</p><div class='indent'>&mdash; Richard Feynman (1918 &ndash; 1988)
</div><div class='vspace'></div><h2>Pursue Science [Bush]</h2>
<div class='round lrindent quote' > 
<p>&ldquo;To pursue science is not to disparage the things of the
spirit. In fact, to pursue science rightly is to furnish the framework
on which the spirit may rise.&rdquo;

<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Pale Blue Dot [Sagan]</h2>
<div class='round lrindent quote' > 
<div class='vspace'></div><div  style='text-align: center;'><img src='http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=uploads.Main.Quotes.palebluedot.jpg' alt='' title='' /></div>
<p class='vspace'>&ldquo;Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. <strong>In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.</strong>
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. <strong>To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.</strong>&rdquo; 
</p><div class='indent'>&mdash; Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space
</div><p class='vspace'>(And a rather nice visualization of the above at vimeo: <iframe src='http://player.vimeo.com/video/51960515?title=1&amp;byline=1&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;loop=0' width='400' height='327' frameborder='0'></iframe> -- I hope it plays better for you than it does for me.)

<div class='vspace'></div><h2>The purpose of power [Orwell, 1984]</h2>
<div class='round lrindent quote' > 
<p>&ldquo;Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know what no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now you begin to understand me.&rdquo;

</div><div class='vspace'></div><h2>I warn you [Neil Kinock]</h2>
<div class='round lrindent quote' > 
<p>If Margaret Thatcher is re-elected as prime minister on Thursday, I warn you.
<br  />I warn you that you will have pain&ndash;when healing and relief depend upon payment.
<br  />I warn you that you will have ignorance&ndash;when talents are untended and wits are wasted, when learning is a privilege and not a right.
<br  />I warn you that you will have poverty&ndash;when pensions slip and benefits are whittled away by a government that won&rsquo;t pay in an economy that can&rsquo;t pay.
<br  />I warn you that you will be cold&ndash;when fuel charges are used as a tax system that the rich don&rsquo;t notice and the poor can&rsquo;t afford.
<br  />I warn you that you must not expect work&ndash;when many cannot spend, more will not be able to earn. When they don&rsquo;t earn, they don&rsquo;t spend. When they don&rsquo;t spend, work dies.
<br  />I warn you not to go into the streets alone after dark or into the streets in large crowds of protest in the light.
<br  />I warn you that you will be quiet&ndash;when the curfew of fear and the gibbet of unemployment make you obedient.
<br  />I warn you that you will have defence of a sort&ndash;with a risk and at a price that passes all understanding.
<br  />I warn you that you will be home-bound&ndash;when fares and transport bills kill leisure and lock you up.
<br  />I warn you that you will borrow less&ndash;when credit, loans, mortgages and easy payments are refused to people on your melting income.
<br  />If Margaret Thatcher wins on Thursday&ndash;
<br  />&ndash; I warn you not to be ordinary
<br  />&ndash; I warn you not to be young
<br  />&ndash; I warn you not to fall ill
<br  />&ndash; I warn you not to get old.

</p><h2>Never leave that until tomorrow which you can do today [Grey &rarr; Franklin]</h2>
<p>&ldquo;A couple hundred years ago Benjamin Franklin shared with the world the secret of his success. Never leave that 'til tomorrow, which you can do today. This is the man who discovered electricity; you'd think we'd pay more attention to what he had to say. I don't know why we put things off, but if I had to guess it has a lot to do with fear. Fear of failure, fear of pain, fear of rejection. Sometimes the fear if just of making a decision. Because... What if you're wrong? What if you make a mistake you can't undo? Whatever it is we're afraid of, one thing holds true: That by the time the pain of not doing the thing gets worse than the fear of doing it, it can feel like we're carrying around a giant tumor. And you thought I was speaking metaphorically... 'The early bird catches the worm.' 'A stitch in time saves nine.' 'He who hesitates is lost.' We can't pretend we haven't been told. We've all heard the proverbs, heard the philosophers, heard our grandparents warning us about wasted time; heard the damn poets urging us to seize the day. Still, sometimes we have to see for ourselves. We have to make our own mistakes. We have to learn our own lessons. We have to sweep today's possibility under tomorrow's rug until we can't anymore. Until we finally understand for ourselves what Benjamin Franklin meant. That knowing is better than wondering. That waking is better than sleeping. And that even the biggest failure, even the worst most intractable mistake, beats the hell out of not trying.&rdquo;

Russell immediately replied, &ldquo;Add 1 to both sides of the equation: then we have 2 = 1. The set containing just me and the Pope has 2 members. But 2 = 1, so it has only 1 member; therefore, I am the Pope.&rdquo;

<p><a name='picard01' id='picard01'></a>
You know, there are some words I??ve known since I was a schoolboy: &ldquo;With the first link, the chain is forged. The first speech censured, the first thought forbidden, the first freedom denied, chains us all irrevocably.&rdquo; Those words were uttered by Judge Aaron Satie [a character in the Next Gen universe] as wisdom and warning. The first time any man's freedom is trodden on we're all damaged.

</div><div class='vspace'></div><h2>Part of the whole [Einstein]</h2>
<p><a name='einstein01' id='einstein01'></a>
A human being is a part of the whole, called by us "Universe", a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest ?? a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. 
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security.

You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things. They push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.

Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back-- Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one elementary truth that ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamed would have come his way. <strong>Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. Begin it now.</strong>"

</div><div class='vspace'></div><h2>Language purity -- English thuggery</h2>

</p><div class='indent'>&mdash; Buckminster Fuller
</div><div class='vspace'></div><h2>Social burdens</h2>
<p>[There is] a social burden placed on schools by poverty, drug abuse, violence and hopelessness.  Troubled children carry the ills of their homes an dneighborhoods into their classrooms every day.

</p><div class='indent'>&mdash; Wilson Wyatt, Sr.
</div><div class='vspace'></div><h2>Agendas</h2>
<p>They have to convert our agenda into something aggressive. Two guys wanting to be happy together are invading their marriages.

<p>Worrying about what you cannot change is a waste of energy,  and creates its own problem.
</p><div class='indent'>&mdash; Worf
</div><div class='vspace'></div><h2>Perseverating on the past</h2>
<p>You can't have a better tomorrow if you are thinking about yesterday all the time.
</p><div class='indent'>&mdash; Charles F. Kettering

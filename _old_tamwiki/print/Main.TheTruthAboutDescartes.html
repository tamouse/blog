<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Descartes, supreme among philosophers</h2>
<p>Although "I Think, Therefore I Am" was the line on which Descartes
achieved his meteoric rise to stardom, that was not the line he actually
wrote.  So I can't tell you how much pleasure it gives me to put the
record straight, if only for poor Rene's sake.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>You may well wonder how it was that Rene managed to reach Number
One among philosophy's all-time chart-toppers.  Well, as I've indicated,
it was all due to the widespread misunderstanding about his line "I
Think, Therefore I Am".  And to trace the EXACT origin of that I must
take you, by the magic of radio, back to the New Year's Eve party which
Madame Descartes threw to celebrate the advent of 1636.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Here's how it really happened</h2>
<p>She'd decided that as it was to be an informal affair what she'd
serve would be a "buffet" (a French word meaning "we've got more people
than chairs").  As she also intended it to be a late do, with the guests
not arriving until around 11 o'clock, she ran up an enormous bunch of
that Gallic imitation of bacon-and-egg flan they call "Quiches".
</p>
<p class='vspace'>However, Madame made it clear to Rene that although the quiches
would be put out on the sideboard in advance -- "what I DON'T want is
people helping themselves all evening and treading their crumbs into the
Aubusson.  So I'm relying on you to see to it that nobody starts digging
into them until at least an hour after we've seen the New Year in.  Then
they can take plates and eat properly!"
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Ironic, isn't it?  The founder of the Cartesian School relegated
to the position of Securicor for bacon-and-egg flans.  As he said to
Father Dinet -- I haven't mentioned him, but he was a Jesuit priest
who was about Rene's only real mate at that time -- as he said to him,
"I can't think this is in any way advancing my career.  Being sat down
here at the sideboard till one o'clock in the morning, no way will there
be any philosophising done tomorrow.  I'll be like a limp rag."
</p>
<p class='vspace'>To which the good Father rejoined an extremely practical rejoiner.
"Then why don't you use this as WORKING time?  Take a pen and write
while you're sitting here, set your mind for lofty thoughts and if any
arrive, jot them down ona paper serviette.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>"Not a bad idea at all," said Descartes.  "Give us a borrow of
your quill."
</p>
<p class='vspace'>So it was that for the next hour or so, there by the sideboard
the two friends sat and Descartes was able to get off quite a few
zingers relating to corporeal rationality.  It was while he was putting
into shape an eternal verity on adventitious volition that he glanced
up and, to his horror, saw that Father Dinet had absent-mindedly helped
himself to a quiche and was quietly munching it.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>About to open his mouth and exclaim "watch it!" They're not supposed
to be eaten yet," he became aware of something else.  There, not two
yards away -- well within earshot -- stood his wife!!
</p>
<p class='vspace'>There was only one thing to do.  Stealthily, Descartes took another
serviette, scribbled out his warning, then equally furtively, pushed
the serviette under Father Dinet's nose.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>So it was that the whole 300-year-old misunderstanding originated.
That message -- the one which Father Dinet was later to publish to the
world as "I Think Therefore I Am" -- all it referred to was the time-ban
on the bacon-and-egg flans.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The truth is, what Descartes actually wrote was I THINK THEY'RE
FOR 1 A.M.

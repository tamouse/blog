<div class='vspace'></div><h1>MINNASODIANS (aka Minnesnodians)</h1>
<h2>Just in case ya didn't know...</h2>
<ul><li>Minnesota  became the 32nd state on May 11, 1858 and was  originally settled by lost tribes of Swedes &amp; Norwegians seeking refuge from the searing heat of Wisconsin 's winters.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Minnesota gets it's name from the Sioux Indian word "mah-nee-soo-tah," meaning, "No, really...!!!! They eat fish soaked in lye."
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>The state song of Minnesota is "Someday the Vikings will... Aw, never mind."
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>The Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota covers 9.5 million square feet and has enough space to hold 185,000 idiot teenagers yapping away on cell phones.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Madison, Minnesota is known as "the lutefisk capital of the world."   Avoid this city at all costs.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>"The Mary Tyler Moore Show" was set in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and was Mary's first real acting job since leaving the "Dick van Dyke Show."  The show, about a single woman's struggle to find happiness in the big city was originally titled "Life Without Dick," but that was changed for some reason.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Downtown Minneapolis has an enclosed skyway system covering 52 blocks, allowing people to live, work, eat, and sleep without ever going outside. The only downside to this that a  Norwegian occasionally turns up missing.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Cartoonist Charles M. Shultz was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota and grew up in St. Paul.  He was the only artist to accurately depict the perfectly circular heads of Minnesota  natives.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>The Hormel Company of Austin, Minnesota produces 6 million cans of Spam a year, even though no one actually eats it.  Spam is a prized food in Japan &amp; Hawaii--Spam sushi!!
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Minnesota license plates are blue &amp; white and contain the phrase "Blizzards on the 4th of July - you get used to it."
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Frank C. Mars, founder of the Mars Candy Co. Was born in Newport, Minnesota. His 3 Musketeers candy bar originally contained three bars in one wrapper, each filled with a different flavor of nougat -chocolate, Spam and lutefisk.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Tonka trucks continue to be manufactured in Minnetonka, Minnesota, despite the thousands of GI Joe dolls killed by them annually in rollover accidents.  No airbags, no seat belts. These things are deathtraps, I tell ya!
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Author Laura Ingalls Wilder was raised in Walnut Grove, Minnesota, and was famous for writing the "Little House" series of books, as well as inventing the "Spam diet" which consists of looking at a plate of Spam until you lose your appetite.  Much like the "lutefisk diet"
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>The snowmobile was invented in Roseau, Minnesota so as to allow families a means of attending 4th of July picnics.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Minnesotans are almost indistinguishable from Wisconsinites. The only way to tell them apart is to ask if they voted for Mondale in '84.
</li></ul><div class='vspace'></div><hr />
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Cold is a relative thing ya know....</h2>

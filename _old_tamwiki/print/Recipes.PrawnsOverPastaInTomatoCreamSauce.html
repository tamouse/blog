<p class='vspace'>Shallots, garlic, wine, tomatoes, and cream make a fabulous fresh sauce for prawns (or shrimp) and pasta. It is paired with angel hair pasta here, but feel free to use your favorite pasta or even cheese tortellini. Have all your ingredients chopped and ready to go because this dish only takes about 15 minutes to cook from start to finish.

</li><li>4 cloves of crushed garlic (or 2 tablespoons of bottled crushed garlic)
</li><li>1/2 cup red wine (I prefer merlot)
</li><li>6 Roma tomatoes (this is the only kind I will buy from the store) or 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes (drained), chopped
</li><li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano (crushed to release flavor)
</li><li>1/4 teaspoon dried basil

<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Continue cooking until reduced and somewhat thickened. 
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Add prawns and basil to tomato cream sauce and simmer, turning often, only until pink and opaque. (Do not overcook or the prawns will become tough.)

</li></ol><div class='vspace'></div><h2>Variations</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, you can use sun-dried tomatoes in this instead of fresh Roma tomatoes. Don't use any other kind of tomatoes unless you grow them yourself or get them from someone who does. Supermarket tomatoes (even the organics) are grown to be shipped and have virtually no flavour.

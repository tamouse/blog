<p>I've been making pancakes for years and years, since I was a pre-teen.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>I don't know if this really calls for a recipe or not, as I pretty much just follow the directions for making pancakes on the back of the Bisquik box and toss in a huge pile of blueberries.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul><li>3 cups bisquik pancake mix
</li><li>2++ cups milk (this is a lot more than is called for on the box. I like my batter a lot runnier.)
</li><li>2 eggs
</li><li>1 half pint of fresh blueberries <del><em>(I think this can be done with frozen blueberries, but I've never tried it.)</em></del> This works well with frozen blueberries -- I did it without even thawing them out ahead of time.
</li></ul><div class='vspace'></div><h2>Directions</h2>
<ol><li>Mix the first three ingredients into a batter. Adjust the amount of milk to make it the consistency you like. I add a lot more than the box recipe.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Fold in the blueberries, getting them well distributed
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Heat a skillet until a drop of water skitters around the surface but doesn't evaporate
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Pour pancakes in 1/2 cup amounts into the pan. Don't put too many down at once, keep things where you can easily turn them and handle them
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Wait until the top surface bubbles form and break, but don't disappear, then flip the pancake over and cook the other side
</li></ol><p class='vspace'>Serve with maple syrup and bacon for a scumptuous feast!
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Variations</h2>
<p>I think you can do this with pretty much any addition:
</p><ul><li>chocolate chips
</li><li>cut up strawberries
</li><li>cut up raspberries or blackberries (or, if in California: olalaberries!)
</li><li>cut up bananas
</li><li>chopped pecans
</li><li>chopped walnuts
</li></ul><p class='vspace'>Buckwheat blueberry pancakes are <strong>extra</strong> special. Just use buckwheat pancake mix instead of bisquick.

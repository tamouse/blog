</p><div class='round lrindent quote' > 
<p>The Targum may have helped us out of the contradiction, but we still have to understand: what advice is King Solomon giving us?
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The first step is to define the term "ksil." There are numerous descriptions of the ksil throughout Mishlei: "ksilim hate knowledge" (1:22), "licentiousness is a sport for the ksil" (1o:23), "turning away from evil is an abomination to the ksil" (13:19). In short, a <strong>ksil is a person who shuns the life of the mind and embraces the life of the instincts and emotions.</strong>
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The key phrase here is "in accordance with his foolishness." The fundamental principle of arguing with a ksil is to recognize that he is a ksil. King Solomon warns us not to respond to the ksil in the same way we would respond to someone who is ignorant or mistaken. The ksil's problem runs so deep, that he requires an answer tailored to his distorted personality.

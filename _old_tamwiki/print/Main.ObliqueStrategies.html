<p class='vspace'><em>Oblique Strategies</em> were originally conceived by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to get themselves unstuck from situations where creativity was needed but stress was shutting things down mentally. The strategies were written on cards, which one could shuffle and pick from at random in the heat of the moment to get a strategy for getting unstuck.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>In Brian's words:
</p><div class='indent'><em>"These cards evolved from our separate observations of the principles underlying what we are doing. Sometimes they were recognized in retrospect (intellect catching up with intuition), sometimes they were identified as they were happening, sometimes they were formulated. They can be used as a pack (a set of posibilities being continuously reviewed in the mind) or by drawing a single card from a shuffled pack when a dilemma occurs in a working situation. In this case the card is trusted even if it appropriateness is quite unclear. They are not final, as new ideas will present themselves, and others will become self-evident."</em>
</div><p class='vspace'>Oblique strategies can be found several places <a class='external' href='http://lmgtfy.com/?q=oblique+strategies' target='_blank'>on the web</a>. The <a class='external' href='http://www.rtqe.net/ObliqueStrategies/' target='_blank'>Official site</a> offers new versions of the deck for sale.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>I'm copying the strategies here as a reminder to myself about them. I got this list from an <a class='external' href='http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/oblique/oblique.html' target='_blank'>on-line strategies picker</a>.

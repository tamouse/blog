<p class='vspace'>Artificial Intelligence is something that has interested me since my days in university when I first started looking at natural language processing. One of my undergraduate projects to was build a semantic processor, that would be able to discern relationships between words (not really understand meaning, but relationships). Since then, it's been a sort of love-hate thing with the progress in this area. I don't know if we'll ever get to the point of actual computer understanding, but possibly mimicry close enough that you can't tell.

<p class='vspace'>Robotics has more going for it in the realm of both research and real-world applications. Robots have been a favourite meme in science fiction readings, and I am enjoying how they have advanced into our lives in so many ways, and the potential for even further involvement.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>From highly dangerous tasks in hazardous environments, to performing repetitive mundane tasks, robots are doing things all over.

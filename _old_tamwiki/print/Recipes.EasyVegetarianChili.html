This recipe provides opportunities for a <em>lot</em> of variation. The spice measures are really inexact (instead of "tablespoons", I tend to use "mound on palm", for example. :) ). The ingredients can be played with endlessly, even to the point of making minestrone instead of chili. :) (Just add some macaroni and you're there, practically.)

</p><h2>Comments</h2>
<p>I modified this a bit to remove the bell peppers for dietary reasons. Also, the original recipe served 8, I needed to serve 10-12.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>I made this in the morning/early afternoon, and it sat until evening. I think this really made the spices bloom and the flavour was great. Make well ahead of the meal you're serving this for, then, is my <strong>strong</strong> suggestion.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Last time I made this, I opened a can of cream-style corn by mistake. It went in quite nicely, just left out a little broth.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>This is a fairly mild chili as far as heat goes. You can obviously make it heat up with habaneros, jalapenos, or chipotles. It might be interesting to substitute a bottle of salsa for the two cans of tomatoes. Experiment!

<p class='vspace'>The senses have always been our portals into the outer world. We have the classic five that Aristotle talked about &mdash; sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch &mdash; plus more recently recognized senses of balance, temperature, pain, and body position and movement. Each evolved to collect some distinct type of information about our environment, and to tell us our status within it.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>That's largely how we tend to think about the senses, anyway: separately, each one its own distinct way to understand the world around us.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>But in recent years, various findings have emerged to challenge that assumption &mdash; strange illusions in which one sense seemed to change the perceptions of another. One study published in 2000 particularly grabbed people's attention: When researchers at Caltech showed test subjects a brief flash of light accompanied by two quick tones, many people saw two flashes instead of one. The same effect occurred when the researchers tapped their subjects' skin twice as the light flashed. Vision &mdash; considered our most reliable and dominant sense &mdash; could be altered by sound or touch.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>And that wasn't all. Other studies showed that what people saw affected what they heard; that certain types of music or background noise affected how food tasted; and that smells could influence how a texture felt to the touch.

<p class='vspace'>My mom got this recipe out of a newspaper ages and ages ago and it's been a perennial favourite of our family for a long time, and on to other families as well. My friend, Marina, made some glorious modifications to it by adding chopped candied ginger pieces to the batter. Truly a work of art!
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Doing most of the prep work in a food processor makes this an easy recipe. I remember grating carrots as a kid and getting my hands all bloody in the process. Still, I did it gratefully <em>(pi)</em> and would do it again if I didn't have a handy food processor.

<p>This recipe looks so simple, and looks so NOMMY! It originally came from "Cooking with Julia" and was posted at <a class='external' href='http://www.foodbuzz.com/blogs/5229627-irish-soda-bread' target='_blank'>http://www.foodbuzz.com/blogs/5229627-irish-soda-bread</a>. This will be my first foray into baking something more complex than drop biscuits, cake or cookies. This looks easy enough that I'm sure it will turn out!

<p class='vspace'><a name='ingredients' id='ingredients'></a>
</p><h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul><li>4 Cups Flour
</li><li>1 teaspoon baking soda
</li><li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt
</li><li>2 cups Buttermilk <em>(or <a class='wikilink' href='http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Recipes.SouringMilk?action=print'>sour milk</a>)</em>
</li></ul><p class='vspace'><a name='directions' id='directions'></a>
</p><h2>Directions</h2>
<ol><li>Preheat oven to 375&#x2109;. Make sure to position your rack in the middle of the oven.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This way you don??t have to grease a pan. You can just put the dough right onto the sheet. Set this aside.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>In a large bowl put together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir together with a fork until all ingredients are incorporated. Add the buttermilk and stir vigorously until the dough comes together.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface (keep some extra flour handy this dough is VERY sticky). Knead the dough gently for a minute. Do not knead too much! The dough should be soft and malleable.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Pat the dough into a disk about 6 inches across and slash and X across the top of the dough. The X should be about 1/2 an inch deep. I know that seems a bit deep, but do it, you will see what it does when it bakes. Place the dough onto the baking sheet.
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Bake the dough for about 50 minutes or until the dough is golden brown on top. Transfer it to a rack to cool for a few minutes and then slice. Serve warm.

<p>Now, because of the low fat content in the bread it doesn??t last very long. Will be as hard as a blarney stone in 2 days so make sure if you make this you plan on eating all of it, or plan on throwing some out for your birds to enjoy  . I have found that if you put it away immediately after dinner (possibly while still a little warm), it will last about 2 days. That 3rd day though? Forget it!

<p class='vspace'>This will be my first foray into baking, when I make this. I'm looking forward to it!

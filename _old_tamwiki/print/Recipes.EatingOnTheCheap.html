<p class='vspace'>Even if you can't afford the stuff on <a class='wikilink' href='http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Recipes.StockIngredients?action=print'>StockIngredients</a>, there are some things that you should try to keep around to make meal times more interesting.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><a name='foods' id='foods'></a>
</p><h2><a name='toc1' id='toc1'></a>Foods to keep around</h2>
<ul><li>Sri-racha. A Vietnamese chile sauce that makes practically everything taste better. It doesn't need to be refrigerated.
</li><li>Soy sauce. Also essential for giving good flavour to things. Also needs no refrigeration.
</li><li>Peanut butter. A good, cheap source of protein.
</li><li>Ramen. The little celo packets cost about ten to twenty cents a piece and offer a variety of flavours. Also, these can be prepared in many ways other than just making soup.
</li><li>Apples. A good fruit, source of many vitamins, keep a long time without refrigeration.
</li><li>Kraft Dinner. The only caveats about this are it requiring milk and/or butter. But you can make it with just the flavour packet and water if you need to.
</li><li>If refrigeration isn't a problem, cheap bulk hot dogs in large packs make it <a class='wikilink' href='http://wiki.tamouse.org?n=Recipes.DirtCheapDinner?action=print'>easy to get some protein</a>. (I apologize to any vegetarians out there.)
</li><li>Parmesan cheese. The green cans are good enough. If you use it up fast enough, it doesn't need refrigeration. (When I was a kid, this stuff never went in the fridge. Must be modern times.)
</li></ul><p class='vspace'><a name='equipment' id='equipment'></a>
</p><h2><a name='toc2' id='toc2'></a>Essential equipment</h2>
<ul><li>1 plate, 1 bowl, 1 fork, 1 spoon, 1 knife, 1 glass, 1 cup. That's it. Just have to wash them constantly, but you don't need a whole pile of dishes weighing you down.
</li><li>2 quart pot with lid. Essential for cooking ramen, boiling hot dogs, etc.
</li><li>a large spoon for handling whatever is in the pot. 
</li></ul><p class='vspace'><a name='avoid' id='avoid'></a>
</p><h2><a name='toc3' id='toc3'></a>False economies</h2>
<ul><li>Hamburger Helper. This stuff contains hardly anything except a little bit of macaroni and dried sauce. If you want macaroni, just buy a big bag of it. It's cheap and keeps forever. Sauce is just cream of mushroom soup, also cheap in cans and keeps forever. If you want more flavour, add sri-racha and parmesan cheese to it, the green cans are good enough.

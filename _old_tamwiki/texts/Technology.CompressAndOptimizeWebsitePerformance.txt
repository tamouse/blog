Optimizing web site delivery is a way of decreasing the download time of your website to your user's client. To the extent this can be done beforehand, the better, but you can also compress things on the server before sending them down.

!!GZip using PHP ob_start() method
[[#excerpt]]
If your hosting provider does not support mod_gzip module, ob_start() method can be used to enable compression in PHP file. For this you need to copy following line in top of the PHP file. You may want to add this line in start of the header file that gets included in every php.
[[#excerptend]]

(:source lang=php linenum tabwidth=4:)
<?php
if (substr_count($_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING'], "gzip"))
    ob_start("ob_gzhandler");
else
    ob_start();
?>
(:sourceend:)

Above code will check whether your browser supports gzip, if yes, then it send ob_gzhandler method as handle to ob_start method which buffers the output. Thus output is compressed using ob_gzhandler. Only problem with this method is that you have to manually edit all PHP files or should have a header.php file that gets included in all files. There are still ways to achieve this without touching your PHP files. Read following trick.

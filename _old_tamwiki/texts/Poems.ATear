(:linebreaks:)
A tear
a gift
more precious 
than praise or kind words
value beyond reckoning

a spark
of light 
glints off the tear
as it wends its solitary way

captured
in a moment
a lifetime of endurance
solitude more remote
the track of a single signal

life
enduring
finding yet another day dawning
to the endless loneliness

a tear
a gift
(:nolinebreaks:)

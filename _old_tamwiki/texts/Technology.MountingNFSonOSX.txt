[[#excerpt]]
On my local network, I have a linux desktop that has a couple of USB
drives connected to it that I export to my LAN. This shows how to
connect to them from my macbook.
[[#excerptend]]

Linux desktop: xUbuntu 13.04 \\
Macbook: OS/X 10.9 Mavericks

>>warning<<
Note: if you reboot the linux desktop, you have to log all the way in
and click on the drive icons to actually get them mounted in
@@/media@@. This is a '''serious''' limitation that I have yet to
figure out how to work around.

* Make sure the linux desktop exports the drives.

    $ exportfs

* Become root on the macbook.
* Make sure the macbook targets are created:

    pontiki:~ root# mkdir /Volumes/sg3t
    pontiki:~ root# mkdir /Volumes/sg2t
 
* Mount the nfs drives:

    pontiki:~ root# mount_nfs -o hard,bg,rw,tcp caesar:/media/sg3t /Volumes/sg3t
    pontiki:~ root# mount_nfs -o hard,bg,rw,tcp caesar:/media/sg2t /Volumes/sg2t

That should do it.

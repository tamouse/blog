->The Pocket Kit, fitting inside an altoids tin, is easy to keep on hand at all times. This is ideal for anyone who wants to have the essential survival gear along each time they head into the field. Everything fits in the Altoids tin (above). It fulfills all the component groups (see “Make Your Own,” last slide) except for shelter and protection, but add a survival blanket to your pocket and you’ll be covered.

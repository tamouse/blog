PmWiki has the great ability to be "skinned", i.e. the layout and colour scheme that is presented to the user's browser. It is an extremely flexible mechanism, allowing per-group and per-page skins.

Below is a conversation from the [[pmwiki-users mailing list -> PmWiki:MailingLists]] describing briefly how one can accomplish this in a couple of ways:

Subject: [pmwiki-users] Use separate skin for page
Date: Mon, 26 Mar 2012 11:37:39 +0200
From: <publik@...>
To: pmwiki-users <pmwiki-users@pmichaud.com>

I want/need to use a separate skin for some (a few) pages on my site. 

I think I have found out a couple of ways to do this but none of them
"feels right". 

Does anyone "know" the "right" way (AKA "best") to do this in PmWiki?

If it's limited to 3-4 pages or groups then simply a per-page or
per-group customization file would be the preferred.  If there are
more than that then it would probably be better in a simple
conditional in your config.php:

$pagename = ResolvePageName($pagename);
if (in_array($pagename, array('GroupA.PageA', 'GroupB.PageB', [...])))
   $Skin = 'myskin';
else
   $Skin = 'otherskin';

Be aware that ResolvePageName() implicitly calls some functions which
do caching, so this should be late in your config.php.  Obviously
there are other ways to do the conditional besides in_array
(preg_match with an array of REs comes to mind if they fit patterns)
but presumably you've already got that figured out...

If you have limited groups or pages, you can create files 

  pmwiki/local/Group1.php
  pmwiki/local/Group2.Page1.php
  pmwiki/local/Group2.Page2.php

And inside each one, place such content:

<?php
  $Skin = "myotherskin";

If you want to be able to change the skins with a markup (:skin myotherskin:) 
in the wiki page, add something like this in your config.php file:

  Markup('skin', 'directives', '/\\(:skin\\s+([-\\w]+)\\s*:\\)/e',
    "PZZ(SetSkin(\$pagename,'$1'))");

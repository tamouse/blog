You can cook wild rice in the oven instead of the stove top; it can be put directly into casseroles that will bake for a long time, provided there is enough moisture in the casserole.

You can also cook wild rice in the microwave, although I've never tried this. It still takes about half an hour in the microwave, so not altogether clear there is that much convenience in it vs. the stovetop.

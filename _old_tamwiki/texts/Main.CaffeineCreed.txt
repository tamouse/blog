!! The first one I heard:

>>quote font-size=110pct<<
(:linebreaks:)
"It is by caffeine  alone  I set  my mind in motion.
It is by the beans of Java that thoughts acquire speed,
The hands acquire shakes, the shakes become a warning.
It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion."

!!Here's another:

>>quote font-size=110pct<<
(:linebreaks:)
It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion.

The beans become a grind, the grind becomes a shot, 
the shot acquires a créma, water becomes steam,
the milk acquires a froth.

I will turn the inner eye to the path of the caffeine,
and where it has passed there will be only vigorous neuron activity.

It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion.

!!Show Hidden Files on your Mac
Launch the Terminal and enter these commands exactly as shown. The first command activates the ability to see the hidden files:

(:source lang=bash:)
 defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE
(:sourceend:)

Now you must relaunch the Finder by killing it, this is how the changes take effect:

(:source lang=bash:)
 killall Finder
(:sourceend:)

If you want to hide hidden files again (those preceded with a .) and go back to the default Mac settings, you can just type the following:

(:source lang=bash:)
 defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE
(:sourceend:)

Again you will need to kill the Finder so that it can relaunch for changes to take effect:

(:source lang=bash:)
 killall Finder
(:sourceend:)

That’s all there is to it!

!!Show Hidden Files in a Mac Save Dialogue

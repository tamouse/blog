Sometimes, especially during development and test, your Sidekiq queues can grow to enormous lengths, likely when you have a lot of delayed emails if you're just running the rails stack and not running to sidekiq process at the same time. Job failures also contribute to this, as well as volume handling if you're using a real mail service, such as Gmail to handle the mails.

There are a couple of things to do:

# Clear the Sidekiq queue.
# Don't use a real service for email.

This is about handling the first thing. For the second thing, look at [[MailCatcher -> http://mailcatcher.me/]].

!! Clearing out the sidekiq queue.

The simplest thing is set up a rake task to do this:

(:source lang=ruby linenum tabwidth=2 header="Rake Task to clear Sidekiq Queues" :)
class SidekiqUtil

  def self.queues
    ::Sidekiq::Stats.new.queues.keys.map { |name| ::Sidekiq::Queue.new(name) }
  end

  def self.clear_all
    self.queues.each { |q| q.clear }
  end

end

namespace :jobs do
  desc "Clear out the sidekiq job queue"
  task :clear_sidekiq_queue, [:frequency] => :environment do |t, args|
    SidekiqUtil.clear_all
  end
end

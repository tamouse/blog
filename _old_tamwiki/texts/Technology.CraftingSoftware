What I do for my living is write software, aka, programming computers. I have been doing this for a long, long time! I wrote my first BASIC computer program when I was between 6th and 7th grades in summer school, using an old `TTY33 teletype with punched paper tape, talking to an `HP2000 BASIC OS computer that was at the school district office. This was exciting! I eventually wrote a lunar lander program that summer.

Since then, I've rather stuck with it. Although I began my university study in EE, by the 3rd year, I switched completely to CS as it was so much more fun!

I've written in many [[(Technology.)Languages]], and done a whole lot of different things.

Over the course of these many years, I've learned quite a lot about the practice of programming, which I will attempt to share here some insights.

[[Thoughts on the idea of software development craftsmanship -> http://tamouse.org/2012/12/04/code-as-literature-software-dev-as-communication/]] -- a blog post I wrote capturing a rambling monologue on irc on my thoughts about software development as a craft, and code as literature.

These are the current topics: (:pagelist fmt=#inlinesimplename wrap=inline $:Parent="({$Group}.){$Name}" list=trail:). I hope you find them interesting and useful.

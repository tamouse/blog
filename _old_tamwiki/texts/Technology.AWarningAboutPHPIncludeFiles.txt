I had been using the @@.inc@@ extension on include files, but this is a really bad idea. Normally these files aren't interpretted by the PHP interpretter and are passed directly back to the browser as plain text. If they include sensitive code or data, this could be a real security breach. Instead, make sure to append @@.php@@ to the file name so they will be interpretted instead.

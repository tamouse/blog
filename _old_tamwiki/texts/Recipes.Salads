I love salads, all kinds. One of my favourite restaurants in the SFBA is Fresh Choice, which is nothing but salad bar (okay, they do have soups, pasta and potatoes, but really, SALAD!). I can get so stuffed there. My kids used to love eating there as they could pick out all the little things they wanted, like olives to stuff on the ends of their fingers, chopped egg, cheese, raisins, etc. (Maybe you get the idea that they didn't really go for salady things much...) Here are some of my favourite salad recipes.

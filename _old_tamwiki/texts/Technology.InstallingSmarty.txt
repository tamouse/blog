Installing [[Smarty]] is really quite simple on certain distributions.

!! Debian/Ubuntu and derivatives

Simple as running apt-get:

(:source lang=bash:)
# apt-get install smarty
(:sourceend:)

and Bob's your uncle.

The above command puts the smarty installation in one of the standard php library include paths, so you can include it in your [[PHP]] code with:

(:source lang=php:)
require_once('smarty/Smarty.class.php');
(:sourceend:)

!! OS/X

It's a little more difficult to do on OS/X, since there are a few different possibilities, depending on how and where you've installed [[PHP]].

You can always install [[Smarty]] directly yourself, which is simply a matter of downloading the files from http://www.smarty.net/download -- you probably want the latest stable release.

Unpack the .zip file someplace temporarily (I often just do this in my ~/Downloads directory). Then, move the files from the libs directory to an appropriate place on your [[PHP]] [[include path -> http://us.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.include-path]]. You can place them directly in a directory on the include path, or you can do like the Debian install does and put them in a sub-directory called "smarty". 

If you've installed the [[Smarty]] libraries directly on the include path, then the line to include it in your application is:

(:source lang=php:)
require_once('Smarty.class.php');
(:sourceend:)

If you've installed [[Smarty]] in a sub-directory on your include path, then:

(:source lang=php:)
require_once('smarty/Smarty.class.php');
(:sourceend:)

If you've installed [[Smarty]] someplace else entirely, you will need to do 2 things:

# Define the constant SMARTY_DIR to point to the absolute path where [[Smarty]] lives.
# Use the SMARTY_DIR define in your [@require_once@] directive:

(:source lang=php:)
define('SMARTY_DIR','/path/to/smarty/library/'); // SMARTY_DIR **MUST** include the trailing slash
require_once(SMARTY_DIR.'Smarty.class.php');
(:sourceend:)

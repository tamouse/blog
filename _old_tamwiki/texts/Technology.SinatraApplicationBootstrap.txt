[[#excerpt]]
I have been rather smitten with Sinatra, a small web application framework that basically does a bit of routing, dispatching and serving of assets. I wanted to have a nice base to start from for creating new apps. This repository does the trick.

The [[Sinatra]] web application framework is pretty wonderful for building small web applications and services. I have a handful of these I'm working on, and wanted to always start from the same base.

The [[http://github.com|Github]] repository is located at: https://github.com/tamouse/sinatra-app-bootstrap and can easily be cloned for use via:

(:source lang=bash :)
$ git clone https://github.com/tamouse/sinatra-app-bootstrap <appdir>
(:sourceend:)

The above link is for the '''Read-Only''' access. This is best for setting up a new application where you'll be using a different depot for the souce code management.

The [[https://github.com/tamouse/sinatra-app-bootstrap#sinatra-application-bootstrap-template|README]] page at the repository explains how to install, configure and run the application.

As a web designer or web developer, you&rsquo;ve probably heard of Git before, a version control system that has had a swift ascension to ubiquity due in part to GitHub, a social code repository site.

If you&rsquo;d like to learn how to use Git, check out my top 10 favorite Git tutorials for beginners. At the end, you&rsquo;ll also see a list of other educational Git resources.

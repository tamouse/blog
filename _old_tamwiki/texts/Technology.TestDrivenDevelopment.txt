Wikipedia has a good overview on [[(Wikipedia:)Test-driven_development]]

The basic concept is knowing what you want, i.e., the desired outcomes, of a unit of code before you being writing the code. Borrowing from the consulting world, the [[Consulting.ThreeGoldenQuestions]], the ones to ask about a unit of code are:

# What is this unit supposed to do?
# What will this unit enable the application to accomplish?
# How will you know that the unit is behaving as it should?

These questionsn should be answered ''before'' you delve into how you are going to implement the unit of code. Even if you don't yet understand how you will implement the unit, you must understand the "black-box" behaviour of the unit:

* specification of inputs, boundaries
* specification of output or outcomes

In TDD, the workflow is taking small, incremental steps in the full development of the unit:

# %red% RED: %% Create your test and run it, and see that it fails (i.e. the functionality of the unit is not there or working yet)
# %green% GREEN: %% Develop the unit so that the test passes, i.e, the unit is correct.
# %blue% REFACTOR: %% Modify the code so it meets development policies and practices for your application. Make it pretty, redesign for performance, defensibility, maintainability, reliability, etc, if necessary.

Iterate on the above three steps until you have fully specified and developed the unit.

'''Callahan's''' is a mythical bar set in New York State, invented by [[http://www.spiderrobinson.com/|Spider Robinson]] in a series of [[http://tinyurl.com/3jw7z|books]]. The proprieter, one Michael Callahan, runs the place. Drinks are  $0.50, but you have to pay $1 at a time. If you finish your drink, you can toast something and throw your glass into the fireplace for that extra $0.50. At the end of the night, a box of quarters is laid out and you can collect your change. Almost no one takes any change.

Callahan's is about sharing pain, which is lessened, sharing joy, which is increased, and thus refuting the laws of entropy.

There are various Callahan's on the net:

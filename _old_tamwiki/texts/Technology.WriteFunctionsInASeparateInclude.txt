[[#excerpt]]
Many times, I'll find a function I've written can be reused in several places. Rather than storing the function in any particular script, I'll include it in a library file created just for that purpose. I call my library file @@functions.inc.php@@. In it, I put generic functions that can be used across different projects with some minor customization, or in many cases, no customization at all. Examples include some of the functions listed [[PHP|elsewhere]].

My current PHP functions library is available from [[https://gitorious.org/common-php-code/common-php-code|git repo]].

Code reuse is a proven means to cut down on the time it takes to write an application. As one gets more experience writing applications, once can accumulate a significant library of code to reuse. It often takes just a little more work to make something reusable, but is well worth the effort.

Link: [[title attribute usage examples -> http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/title-usage.html]]

The issue that the title= attribute in html tags is not being used in a useful fashion. Frequently, it only mimics the text label in the html itself. The title= attribute is not implemented uniformly across browsers, and when used can get confused with the alt= attribute on img tags.

>>quote<<

Of the pages checked approximatley 90% of title attribute content was a duplicate or similar to the text content of the element the title attribute was associated with.

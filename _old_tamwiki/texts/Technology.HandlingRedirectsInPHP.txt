[[#excerpt]]
Redirects are when one script finishes up processing and then calls another. Typically this is handled via the HTTP header @@Location:@@. In PHP, headers can be set via the @@[[http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.header.php|header()]]@@ function:

(:source lang=php linenum:)
header("Location: index.php");
(:sourceend:)
[[#excerptend]]


>>important<<
HTTP headers must be emitted before any other output. Thus, if you're code sends error messages to the browser before it gets to the @@header("Location: ...");@@ call, that redirect will not work.

!!Perpetuating certain states with query string additions

Sometimes, it is preferrable to pass on query string options that the script uses to the redirect target script/URL. Frequently, I use this mechanism to turn on debugging (See HowToSetUpForDebuggingInPHP.) To do this, I use an associative array containing the query string parameters and values:

(:source lang=php linenum:)
$additional_query_parms['debug'] = DEBUG;
(:sourceend:)

Then, before emitting output or calling a redirect, add in any acculated error messages you man want to display to the user:

(:source lang=php linenum:)
$additional_query_parms['errors'] = $errors;
(:sourceend:)

And build your redirect. I have the following function to do that:

(:source lang=php linenum tabwidth=4:)
/**
 * Build a redirect path including messages, errors, and additional query data
 *
 * @return redirect url
 * @author Tamara Temple <tamara@tamaratemple.com>
 **/
function buildredirect($u=NULL)
{
	global $errors, $messages, $additional_query_parms;
	
	$redirect = (isset($u) ? $u : DEFAULT_REDIRECT);
	$options = Array();
	if (isset($additional_query_parms) && !empty($additional_query_parms)) {
		$options = $additional_query_parms;
	}
	if (isset($messages) && !empty($messages)) {
		$options['messages'] = $messages;
	}
	if (isset($errors) && !empty($errors)) {
		$options['errors'] = $errors;
	}
	debug_var("\$options:",$options);
	if (!empty($options)) {
		$redirect .= "?" . http_build_query($options);
	}
	return $redirect;
	
}
(:sourceend:)

It makes use of the @@[[http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.http-build-query.php|http_build_query()]]@@ function, which does a nice job of handling necessary serializing and urlencoding.

The use of the array @@$additional_query_parms@@ is nice because you can accumulate the parameters throughout your script, and then in a single call build the query string and redirect url.

!!Debugging and Redirects

[[HowToSetUpForDebuggingInPHP|Elsewhere]] I've covered debugging in PHP. Just to reiterate a point made there, often times you don't want your redirect to happen because you will lose debugging information, or the redirect call won't go through because you've already output information to the browser. I have a little @@do_redirect()@@ function that handles this case:

(:source lang=php linenum tabwidth=4:)
/**
 * perform a redirect to the indicated url $u, applying other paramters as needed.
 *
 * @return none - will either redirect or exit
 * @author Tamara Temple
 **/
function do_redirect($u=NULL)
{
	if (!isset($u)) $u = DEFAULT_REDIRECT;
	$u = buildredirect($u);
	debug("Redirect: \$u=$u");
	if (!DEBUG) header("Location: $u"); else exit("<p><a href='$u'>Redirect to $u</a></p>");
}
(:sourceend:)

This nicely handles the case where you may have emitted debugging information to the browser already (in which case, the @@header("Location:...")@@ function won't work) by offering up a link on exit that will in effect do the same thing as the redirect would have.

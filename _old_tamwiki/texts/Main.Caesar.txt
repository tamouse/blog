!!Ceasar, the Cat

Here are some pictures of my cat, Ceasar. He was born sometime in early October 1999, which makes him a Libra, like me :)

I adopted him from the [[http://www.hssv.org|Humane Society of Silicon Valley]] on April 9th, 2000 and he came home with me a couple of days later after seeing the vet about a few things....

Caesar ran away in the Spring of 2001 and I never saw him again.

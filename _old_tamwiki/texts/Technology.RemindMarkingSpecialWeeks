Remind is an extremely powerful, but syntactically-challenging tool. I've no doubt one could create any date specification to get events to work correctly. Setting things up for month-long and week-long events is one of those things.

!! Month-long events
At least in the US, we seem to designate somethings as "National X Month" or "National X Week". The first is really easy:

[@
  REM July MSG The month of %m is something or other month
@]

The above shows something else as well. The ''%m'' variable gives the current month in the output. In addition, the ''%_'' variable causes a new line. This is kind of nice to do something like:

[@
  REM Jan MSG The month of January is: %_ \
    National Bath Safety Month %_ \
    National Blood Donor Month %_ \
    National Braille Literacy Month %_ \
    National Hobby Month %_ \
    Hot Tea Month %_ \
    National Oatmeal Month %_ \
    National Soup Month
@]

Which prints out all those designations indented under the first message line.

!! Week-long events

But making a week-long event is a little harder. You basically have to test if the trigger date is between the bounds of a given week. Luckily, this is easy to set into a function:

[@
  FSET All_Week_1(x)	day(x) <=  7
  FSET All_Week_2(x)	day(x) >=  8 && day(x) <= 15
  FSET All_Week_3(x)	day(x) >= 16 && day(x) <= 22
  FSET All_Week_4(x)	day(x) >= 23 && day(x) <= 29
  FSET All_Week_5(x)	day(x) >= 30
@]

Then, in your recipe, you simply put:

[@
  REM <month> SATISFY [All_Week_1($T)] MSG First week of %m is %_ \
     events
@]

Where <month> is the month name, e.g. July, Aug, etc.

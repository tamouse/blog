The following is taken from a write-up I made at
[[http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/PmWiki/BackupAndRestore | the PmWiki site]]
discussing how to use rsync to effectively back up only the portions
of the wiki you are interested in using the [@--exclude-from@] tag and
an exclude file.

!! Using rsync

[[#excerpt]]
[@rsync@] is an extremely useful solution to backing up files to or from a
remote location, provided you have ssh access to the remote
machine. The rsync man page lists tons of options and examples for
doing this well.
[[#excerptend]]


A simple example of using rsync to replicate your wiki:

(:source lang=bash:)
    $ rsync -av user@server:path/to/wiki/ local/path/to/backup
(:sourceend:)

This will bring over '''everything''', including the pmwiki software
and such, which you probably don't really need in a backup
situation.

!!Inclusions and Exclusions: rsync filtering

Luckily, rsync let's you include and exclude things by using an
@@--exclude-from@@ parameter that you can drop file glob patterns
into.

It's a bit arcane, and the man page is less than helpful, but I've
come up with a set of filter rules that seem to work for backing up
the important content of your wiki.

Create a file called, say, @@exclusions@@, and fill it with:
[@
    # Exclude stuff from pmwiki except some
    + /cookbook/
    + /wiki.d/
    - /wiki.d/.flock
    - /wiki.d/.pageindex
    - /wiki.d/.lastmod
    - /wiki.d/*,del-*
    - /wiki.d/*/*,del-*
    + /pub/
    + /local/
    + /uploads/
    - /*
    - **~
    - **,v
    - **.bak
    - **.tgz
    - **.zip
    - **.gz
    - **.Z
@]

This will allow the files matching include patters (prefix "+") and
prevent the files matching exclude patterns (prefix "-") from being
included in the rsync. Note well that the include patterns need to come
before the exclude patterns. Here's what's going on above:

||border=1
|| @@+ /cookbook/@@||include the cookbook directory at the top level of the directory tree (i.e. if cookbook reappears in a subdirectory). ||
|| @@+ /wiki.d/@@||include the wiki.d directory, again at the top level only ||
|| @@- /wiki.d/.flock@@||'''ex'''clude the .flock file under wiki.d ||
|| @@- /wiki.d/.pageindex@@||exclude the .pageindex ||
|| @@- /wiki.d/.lastmod@@||exclude .lastmod ||
|| @@- /wiki.d/*,del-*@@||exclude deleted pages ||
|| @@- /wiki.d/*/*,del-*@@||exclude deleted pages in a Group direcotry setting ||
|| @@+ /pub/@@||include the pub directory ||
|| @@+ /local/@@||include the local directory ||
|| @@+ /uploads/@@||include the uploads directory ||
|| @@- /*@@||exclude all other directories and files in root. ||

This last line here is really the key to the whole thing. If you don't
have this line, you'll still get most everything in the
installation. It basically says "exclude everything else from here".

What follows are more miscelaneous matching patterns for various kinds
of files that may appear in the included directories up above.

|| @@- **~@@||typical editor backupt file, such as emacs. the double star means match everything. ||
|| @@- **,v@@||RCS vault file ||
|| @@- **.bak@@||another type of backup file, usually from filters ||
|| @@- **.tgz@@||tarballs, generally don't want to include those in your personal arvhive. ||
|| @@- **.zip@@||zip files, similar to tarballs ||
|| @@- **.gz@@||gzipped files, frequently tarballs are ended .tar.gz ||
|| @@- **.Z@@||compressed files ||

''(Note: you may have good reason '''not''' to exclude some of the types of files I've shown above. Feel free to modify the above list; add and subtract entries as needed.)''

Once you have your exclude file set up, then run the following command:

(:source lang=bash:)
    $ rsync -av --exclude-from=exclusions user@server:path/to/wiki local/path/to/backup
(:sourceend:)

!!Testing your download before doing it

Rsync has a nice parameter, @@--dry-run@@, which lets you see what
it's going to do before you commit to the download. This is great for
checking yout inclusions and exclusions to make sure nothing comes over
that you don't want.

!!Further

There are many more options to rsync that can make it the ideal backup
solution, including making incremental and full backups, etc.

!!Important to remember

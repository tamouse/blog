[[PostgreSQL -> http://www.postgresql.org/]]
is an [[open-source -> Wikipedia:Open_Source]]
[[object-relational database management system -> Wikipedia:Object-relational_database]]
that was built on the old Ingres DBMS. It has arisen as a strong
alternative to [[MySQL]] among open source applications, and Rails web
applications in particular as MySQL has come under the control of
Oracle. 

The two do not have 100% identical implementations of the SQL
language. This, in turn, affects systems that strive to provide
database independence and agnosticism, such as Rails'
`ActiveRecord. There are some commands that don't work the same.

!! Obtaining Table Structure Information

(:nolinkwikiwords:)
(:table width=100act cellpadding=10 border=1:)
(:headnr:)
MySQL
(:head:)
PostgreSQL
(:cellnr:)
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.table_structure("my_table")
(:cell:)
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.columns("my_table")
(:tableend:)
(:linkwikiwords:)

(:source lang=ruby linenum tabwidth=2 header="Displaying the structure of a PostgreSQL table" :)
FORMAT = "| %-20s | %-10s | %-15s |\n"
printf FORMAT, "Name", "Type", "NULL allowed?"
printf FORMAT, "-"*20, "-"*10, "-"*15
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.columns("quotes").map do |col|
  printf FORMAT, col.name, col.type.to_s, col.null.to_s  
end
(:sourceend:)
(:source lang=text header="Output":)
| Name                 | Type       | NULL allowed?   |
| -------------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| id                   | integer    | false           |
| quote_text           | text       | true            |
| quote_hash           | integer    | true            |
| created_at           | datetime   | true            |
| updated_at           | datetime   | true            |

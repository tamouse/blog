This is the most important effect of the Occupy movement: acts of
defiance, courage and conscience are contagious. Just as the Arab
Spring clearly played some significant role in spawning, sustaining
and growing the American Occupy movement, so too have the Occupy
protesters emboldened one another and their fellow citizens. The
protest movement is driving the proliferation of new forms of
activism, citizen passion and courage, and &mdash; most important of
all &mdash; a sense of possibility.

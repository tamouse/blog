The [[rvm]] tool installs various rubys and such, but seems to omit the [[rdoc]] so you can use the [[ri]] tool locally.

Simple to create them:

  $ rvm docs generate all

This will take quite a while, probably, so launch in it's terminal window and let it go.

Summary: You need the ruby documentation in order to use ri -- faster than the googling or searching/navigating through ruby-doc.

[[#excerpt]]
Extracting URLs from an HTML file has been a common enough task that it's been written about all over.
Here, I'm taking it a little further, comparing implementations of the task in perl and ruby using modern libraries that parse HTML turning it into a tree of DOM objects, just the way your browser would do it.
This makes extraction and subsequent processing much simpler than older methods of building parser callbacks, or just using regexps to parse the file.

!! Use of Modern Parsing Libraries

Both implementations make similar use of libraries written for each language that convert the HTML in a given file into something traversable by tags, ids, or classes, which makes for extremely simple, yet powerful manipulation of the DOM tree.

This is very much the same way jQuery handles the DOM, by offering up a very simple selection syntax to the programmer.

!! The extract method, side-by-side

(:div style="display: inline-block; width=49%;vertical-align:top;":)
(:source lang=perl linenum:)
sub extract {
	my $p = shift;
	my @anchors = $p->getElementsByTagName('a');
	foreach my $anchor (@anchors) {
		my $href = $anchor->getAttribute('href');
		print "$href\n" if $href;
	}
	my @images = $p->getElementsByTagName('img');
	foreach my $img (@images) {
		my $src = $img->getAttribute('src');
		print "$src\n" if $src;
	}
}
(:sourceend:)
(:div style="display: inline-block; width=49%;vertical-align:top;":)
(:source lang=ruby linenum:)
def extract (doc)
	doc.search("a").each do |a|
		puts a.attribute('href')
	end
	doc.search("img").each do |i|
		puts i.attribute('src')
	end
end
(:sourceend:)
(:divend:)

The immediate thing I note is that the size of the ruby version is like half the size of the perl version, and it looks a lot easier to read to me (granted, I understand how to read boty langauges easily).

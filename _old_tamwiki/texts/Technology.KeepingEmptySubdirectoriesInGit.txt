[[#excerpt]]
Normally, [[(Technology.)Git]] does not track empty subdirectories. This is a method to make sure they are included.

!! The Problem:
Git does not add empty subdirectories to the tree when doing a @@git add --all@@ or @@git commit -a@@. This is sometimes a problem where you want to create a package that will have directories defined, but may not be filled in until after the package is installed somewhere.

!! One Solution:
A convention has emerged to place a file called @@.gitkeep@@ in the subdirectory. This file has no meaning to git, it is merely a place holder that forces git to add the subdirectory to the tree.

!! A Better Solution:
A ''better'' option, I feel, is to add a @@README@@ file to the subdirectory with a bit of explanation as to what the purpose of the subdirectory is. This docments to the user what to expect in the subdirectory.

umm -- isn't this explained in the CGI.pm Pod?  'Creating a File Upload
Field' describes how to do this:


  print $q->start_multipart_form(),
		  $q->filefield(-name='uploadfile',-size='50'),
		  $q->endform;


and you process the file. If you're expecting binary (or you don't know what
to expect), then process the file using binary reads:


  $filename = $q->param('uploadfile');
  open OUT '>/tmp/safe/place/to/store/files.bin';
  while ($bytesrd=read($filename,$buffer,1024)) {
	  print OUT $buffer;
  }
  close OUT;


and now you can continue to futz with the file all you want.

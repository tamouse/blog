(:toc-float:)Starving student, starving artist, starving person with no income? Here are some things to make eating still enjoyable.

Even if you can't afford the stuff on [[StockIngredients]], there are some things that you should try to keep around to make meal times more interesting.

[[#foods]]
!!Foods to keep around
* Sri-racha. A Vietnamese chile sauce that makes practically everything taste better. It doesn't need to be refrigerated.
* Soy sauce. Also essential for giving good flavour to things. Also needs no refrigeration.
* Peanut butter. A good, cheap source of protein.
* Ramen. The little celo packets cost about ten to twenty cents a piece and offer a variety of flavours. Also, these can be prepared in many ways other than just making soup.
* Apples. A good fruit, source of many vitamins, keep a long time without refrigeration.
* Kraft Dinner. The only caveats about this are it requiring milk and/or butter. But you can make it with just the flavour packet and water if you need to.
* If refrigeration isn't a problem, cheap bulk hot dogs in large packs make it [[DirtCheapDinner|easy to get some protein]]. (I apologize to any vegetarians out there.)
* Parmesan cheese. The green cans are good enough. If you use it up fast enough, it doesn't need refrigeration. (When I was a kid, this stuff never went in the fridge. Must be modern times.)


[[#equipment]]
!!Essential equipment
* 1 plate, 1 bowl, 1 fork, 1 spoon, 1 knife, 1 glass, 1 cup. That's it. Just have to wash them constantly, but you don't need a whole pile of dishes weighing you down.
* 2 quart pot with lid. Essential for cooking ramen, boiling hot dogs, etc.
* a large spoon for handling whatever is in the pot. 

[[#avoid]]
!!False economies
* Hamburger Helper. This stuff contains hardly anything except a little bit of macaroni and dried sauce. If you want macaroni, just buy a big bag of it. It's cheap and keeps forever. Sauce is just cream of mushroom soup, also cheap in cans and keeps forever. If you want more flavour, add sri-racha and parmesan cheese to it, the green cans are good enough.

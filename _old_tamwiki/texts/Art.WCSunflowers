[[#excerpt]]
This was an exercise to develop a composition, and painting fast and loose.

!! Source photo

Attach:sourcephoto.700.jpg"Source photo" | This was the source photo I used today for creating the composition.


The source photo shown above is not so bad for a photograph, but really doesn't serve well for a painting. We discussed "Rule of Threes", which is basically dividing the space into a 3x3 grid, and the main focal point (or points) should land on the intersections:

!! Composition attempts

!! First Comp
%width=350px%Attach:2012-09-25.comp1.jpg"First Pencil Sketch"
The first thing I tried was to take the source photo, and trace onto the sketchpad 3 likely flowers, using the taller one on the right, and then taking the shorter one on the left and tracing it a two slightly different angles, thus making a set of three flowers.

!!Further Comps

Unhappy with that, I decided to just free-form some sketches:

# %width=200px%Attach:2012-09-25.comp3.jpg"Third Pencil Sketch"
# %width=200px%Attach:2012-09-25.comp4.jpg"Fourth Pencil Sketch"


-> This last attempt, I think, worked the best: converting the composition to vertical, making the two on the right smaller and off the same stalk, the one on the left bigger and more in the foreground.

!! Colour Sketches

Rather than striking off directly into a full painting, I still wanted to try to get a feel for this. So I used my watercolour stock postcards and painted miniature sketches instead.

!!! First colour sketch

I first laid down the washes for the background:
* a mix of cobalt scarlet and permanent rose for the barn side,
* cerulean blue for the area off the edge of the barn, and
* quin burnt orange with a little french ultramarine for the bottom.

After letting that dry, I put in the flower centers using just quin burnt orange.

After that was dry, I put in the petals using cobalt yellow deep.

Then came the stalks and leaves, mixing phthalo green with new gamboge, both in the palette and directly on the paper, letting things mingle a little.

Finally painted in some ground areas using a mix of qbo and fr. ultramarine.

Overall, this is a much less than satisfying attempt.

!!! Second colour sketch

The second sketch I started, I decide to flip the background around as well as the flowers.

This time, I began by only wetting the background around the flowers, stalks and leaves, rather than the whole thing, in order to let the paint flow into and around them, but not through them, using quin burnt scarlet for the barn wall. I wanted the wash to be a gradient, flowing from dark on the right to light on the left. I think I got this to work ok, but the dried value is still too light. I'd like it a lot darker.

Next, I did the flower petals in a very very light tint of aureolin, as well as laying down a base on the leaves.

Then, as that dried, I laid in an inner right of cad. yellow deep for the middle ring. After than, cad. scarlet for the inner ring while the cad. yellow was stil a bit wet. I mixed in a slight touch of fr. ultra in the flower on the right that is behind the other one to give a shadowing offset, marking the shape of the flower in front with some negative painting.

Following that, while I waited for the petal parts to dry, I stared in on the stalks. Using the cad. yellow deep, I gave a light part to the stem's edges. Following, I used phthalo green mixed with new gamboge and a touch of qbo to fill in the stems. I applied the same technique to the leaves, leaving them a little wet. Finally, I applied a mix of phthalo green and permanent alizerin crimson to some of the leaves to give a shadow blending effect, and to provide more negative painting effects to define the shapes of the flower petals.

Going to keep working at this one:
* darken the barn, to provide more negative painting effects to shape the flowers
* fill in the flower centers
* add something to the left, sky/background - make the edge of the barn distinctive.

Finished this off and I thought it ended up pretty well. I have a pretty good feeling for how the final will turn out.

!!! Value Study

I only had a few minutes left in the class, and didn't want to start on the final piece, so I did a value study. I like the fast, loose style of this, and hope to replicate that in the final version. The two sunflowers on the right need some more differentiation in the final, but otherwise I am quite happy with this composition overall.

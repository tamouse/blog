[[#excerpt]]
I don't espouse any particular religion or set of beliefs. I am most closely allied with atheism in that I have a hard time believing in supernatural things, or for their ability to affect things physically if they do exist, so they are largely irrelevant to me. There are things which I do think relate to spirituality and beliefs, however, which are important to me and possibly to others. I have derived great benefit from practices of meditation and some kinds of prayer. While I don't necessarily believe that my prayers actually affect anyone else directly, they do affect me, and in turn, I can affect others.

Here are some things I've captured dealing with Sprirituality and Beliefs.

----

!!Prayers

!!!Serenity Prayer, expanded

God, Grant me:
* '''Clarity''', amidst confusion
* '''Hope''', amidst despair
* '''Faith''', in the world and in myself
* '''Serenity''' to accept that which I cannot change
* '''Courage''' to change the things I can
* and the '''Wisdom''' to know the difference

!!!Serenity Prayer, '''revised'''
Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,\\
The courage to change the person I can\\
And the wisdom to know that person is '''me'''.

----

Bless them and change me!

!!!Morning Prayer
I open my ears That I may hear the wisdom of my ancestors. 
I open my eyes that I may see with vision and clarity.  
I open my mouth that I may speak with gentle intelligence and compassion.  
I open my heart that I may love and be loved.  
I open my arms to receive the bountiful gifts of the [Universe].
Blessed be this day.

[[Jekyll -> http://jekyllrb.com]] is a static site generator that is
blog-aware. Written in ruby, it provides a simple framework for
creating content, formatting it, and publishing it.

Also of note is [[Octopress -> http://octopress.org]] which is a more
complete blogging platform built atop Jekyll.

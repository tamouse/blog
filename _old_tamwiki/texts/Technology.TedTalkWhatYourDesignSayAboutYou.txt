(:title TED Talk: What your designs say about you - Sebastian Deterding:)

Link: [[Sebastian Deterding: What your designs say about you -> http://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_deterding_what_your_designs_say_about_you.html]]

In this talk, Deterding provides questions designers should ask about the things they are designing, and what moral impacts designs have on their users.

# What is your intention?

# What is the desired effect?

# What values does the design embody and reinforce?

# What virtues does it uphold?

Ultimately, according to Deterding, designs should be about life.

->''"Why should the lamp or the house be an art object by not our life?"''
-->-- Michel Foucault, ''Ethics: Subjectivity and Truth (1997)''

[[TclTk|Tcl]] is very finicky about where things are placed. Unlike other programming languages, location and white space seem to make a big difference to Tcl.

For example, compare the brace placement on this snippet:

(:source language=tcl linenum tabwidth=4 highlight='1, 2' :)
proc ::testegg::msg_test {nick userhost hand text}
{
    set msg "nick=$nick. userhost=$userhost. hand=$hand. text=$text"
    putcmdlog [concat "testegg: " $msg]
    putserv [concat "PRIVMSG " $nick " :" $msg]
    return 1
}
(:sourceend:)

to the brace placement on this one:

(:source language=tcl linenum tabwidth=4 highlight='1':)
proc ::testegg::msg_test {nick userhost hand text} {
    set msg "nick=$nick. userhost=$userhost. hand=$hand. text=$text"
    putcmdlog [concat "testegg: " $msg]
    putserv [concat "PRIVMSG " $nick " :" $msg]
    return 1
}
(:sourceend:)

The first example will fail, because Tcl wants the body opening brace to be on the same line as the proc command.

I think it took me about 3 hours to figure that out...

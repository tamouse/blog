'''The problem of beer'''&nbsp; That it is within a 'bottle', i.e. a boundaryless compact 2-manifold homeomorphic to the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere | sphere]].&nbsp; Since beer bottles are not (usually) pathological or "[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_horned_sphere | wild]]" spheres, but [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_manifold | smooth manifolds]], they separate 3-space into two non-communicating regions: ''inside'', containing beer, and ''outside'', containing you.&nbsp; This state must not remain.

'''A proposed solution'''&nbsp; Clearly the elegant course is to introduce a non-orientable manifold, which has one side and does not divide 3-space.&nbsp; When juxtaposed with the beer-bounding manifold described above, it acts to disrupt the continuity thereof, canceling the outdated paradigm of distinction between interior and exterior.&nbsp; This enables the desired interaction between beer and self.

'''Implementation'''&nbsp;The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle | Klein Bottle]] Opener[^This 3D-printed sculpture is tumble finished with a heat-treated patina that brings out the bronze color of the metal.&nbsp; It is unsigned.^]' shown above is an example.&nbsp; It is palm-sized, durably constructed in stainless steel, effective[^Yes, it really works!^], and blissfully ergonomic.

'''Q E D'''&nbsp; You need one.

!! "What will ''that'' get for you?"

[[#excerpt]]
This question establishes motive and intent. It is useful to ask this because the reasons for wanting a certain thing are often complex, and before there can be a well-formed DesiredState (see also WellFormedOutcomes), we must know the reasons why the client wants what they want.
[[#excerptend]] 

Sometimes the client doesn't know why they want something. This is why it is important to couch the question the way it is written. Simply asking "Why do you want that?" (see NeverAskWhy) leaves things far too open for the client to give any answer. The question, as written, will direct the client to think of outcomes, which is what we want here.

It is also useful to explore this territory for awhile. Ask the question at least three times or until you get a business reason, as opposed to a procedural or technical reason.

!!Some other ways to ask the question include:

* What will you be able to do when you have that?
* What is even more important than having that?
* What problem does having that solve for you?

Mini:bungles-milkyway-pano2.jpg"Arching Milky Way over the Bungle Bungles"

[[http://www.mikesalway.com.au/2012/07/25/milky-way-galaxy-over-the-domes-of-the-bungle-bungles/ | Milky Way Galaxy over the Domes of the Bungle Bungles]].
->''You know the skies are dark when you can see the Milky Way overhead, even when there’s a more than half-moon shining brightly high in the west sky. And that’s what it was like at the Bungle Bungles. This image is an 8 frame panorama, taken on Piccaninny Creek bed with my Canon 5D Mk II and Samyang 14mm f/2.8 lens, while the Canon 40D was taking a star trails image. Seeing the arching milky way over the domes of the Bungle Bungles reminds me of those fantastic two nights in Purnululu National Park – a stunning array of domes, cliffs, gorges, bushland and dark dark skies. Each frame was a 30s exposure, f/2.8 `ISO3200. Panorama created using Auto Pano Pro, and the image was processed in Photoshop `CS5. I was very excited to see this image chosen as [[NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) for September 11th, 2012 -> http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120911.html]]. What a thrill!''

Oh, the @@remind@@ program, how I love and loathe thee. Remind is a program that is used to remind you of appointments, holidays, and the like, and can be used to generate appointment calendars. It's a farily nifty program, but the syntax is rather horrendous.

!! Obtaining and installing remind
You can obtain remind from http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind, who now supports it. Installation is simple, it's very self-contained.

!! Ecosystem

:There's a remind mailing list at: http://lists.roaringpenguin.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/remind-fans
:There is also a remind wiki at: http://www.roaringpenguin.com/wiki/index.php/Remind




!! Using remind
Remind reads a @@.rem@@ file, alternatively, it can read a directory of @@.rem@@ files. The command line is basically:

[@
  remind [OPTIONS] filename [date] [*rep] [time]
@]

''filename'' can either be a single file, or a directory, of which only the files ending in @@.rem@@ will be read.

Things like birthdays and holidays are very simple to do in remind:

[@
  REM 13 December MSG Dad's Birthday!
@]

Remind has this somewhat annoying feature that every message it spits out has an extra line feed. To avoid this, place a percent (%) sign at the end of the message:

[@
  REM 13 December MSG Dad's Birthday! %
@]

!!! Something a little more advanced:

[@
  REM 13 SATISFY [wkdaynum($T) == 5] MSG Happy Triskaidekaphilia Day!%
@]

@@SATISFY@@ is used to determine whether to fire the reminder based on some characteristics other than the actual trigger date. The above only fires when the 13th falls on a Friday (weekday number 5).

!! Collections of remind files

I have been keeping a collection of remind files as a git repository at https://gitorious.org/nix-utilities/remind-files which includes at least one file you really want to have: @@00-defs.rem@@ as this sets up several useful and interesting definitions that can be used in your reminder recipes.


!! Making your .rem files available everywhere

I work on several different computers and portable devices. The simplest way to keep all these computers in sync with the same remind files is to use something like [[Dropbox -> http://dropbox.com]] and putting your .rem files in a directory in your @@~/Dropbox@@ directory. They you just point the @@remind@@ command at that directory:

[@
  remind [options] ~/Dropbox/Reminders
@]

and Bob's your Uncle.

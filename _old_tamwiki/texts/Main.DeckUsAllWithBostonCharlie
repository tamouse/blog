Deck us all with Boston Charlie, 
Walla walla, Wash., an' Kalamazoo! 
Nora's freezin' on the trolley, 
Swaller dollar cauliflower alley'garoo!

(:linebreaks:)

Don't we know archaic barrel, 
Lullaby lilla boy, Louisville Lou? 
Trolley Molly don't loue Harold, 
Boola boola Pensacoola hullabaloo! 

Bark us all bow-wows of folly, 
Polly wolly cracker n'too-da-loo! 
Donkey Bonny brays a carol, 
Antelope Cantaloup, 'lope with you!

Hunky Dory's pop is lolly gaggin' on the wagon, 
Willy, folly go through! 
Chollie's collie barks at Barrow, 
Harum scarum five alarum bung-a-loo! 

Duck us all in bowls of barley, 
Hinky dinky dink an' poIly voo! 
Chilly Filly's name is Chollie, 
Chollie Filly's jolly chilly view halloo! 

Bark us all bow-wows of folly, 
Double-bubble, toyland trouble! Woof, Woof, Woof! 
Tizzy seas on melon collie! 
Dibble-dabble, scribble-scrabble! Goof, Goof, Goof!

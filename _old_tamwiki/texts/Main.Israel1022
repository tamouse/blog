Word for the day "OBEDIENCE"

!!08:30, Church of the Beatitudes.
took several photos at the Church of the Beatitudes: duomo, gate, mosaics, altar, framed shots down to sea of Galilee,

In chapel, stations of the cross, most people going around the wrong way (right handed) !! :-)

Morning service, prayer to God to give up, surrender, ask for what we need.

!!10.30 Tabgha

* #20: Jewish ritual bath, where our practise of baptism comes from. Jewish tradition is that the person being conferred is the only one to enter the water. The sponsor or conferrer stands by the side.

multiplication of fishes and loaves. Church of heptapegon (the seven springs) 
* 28-350 CE large rock veerated byjudeo christans 
* 350 rockued as altar 
* 480 byzatine church 
* 614 persian invasion, destroyed church 
* 1928 restoration began

church interior - modern, 20th century gothic construction. - some gorgeous mosaics on the floors - what is the meaning of the different birds in the mosaics? No special meaning, they are birds from Egypt, which is where the Bishop was from. The only bird with special meaning is the peacock which is for eternal life.

Very beautiful acoustics, we sounded great! Some harmonies. - Carol passed out small prayer rocks with a small design reminiscient of the mosaics in the floor. #22 mosaic on floor under altar, next to the rock that Jesus used to speak from. (Not in the story of the loaves & fishes; that was from a boat.)

Sea of Galilee is very flat, usually flat. One pass has a canyon and it is the source of strong winds; the winds are very unusual in the Galilee (it is a source of inquiry). All through the sea of Galilee, there are natural coves, which form amphitheatres. The combination of the reflected sound in the amphitheatre and off the water, the wind coming from behind the speaker, and the fact that there were no industrial sounds at all, made for an specially good acoustics, and crowd presentations. Hence Jesus could easily have spoken to 5000 people.

!! 11:23 am capernaum

* #26: St. Peter' home, surrounded by octagonal church the structure overhead is a modern construction of a cantilever design, suspended over peter's house.
* #33: Barbara Coyle in the Moses seat.

Synagogue from Crist's day. Faces towards Jerusalem. Teaching was done sitting down and talking to a close group of students. Debated by others, taking up specific points and argueing them. then others would join in the debate, Many languaes were spoken in the area, some simultaneously. Religious answers, quotations from the Bible were in Hebrew; other talk was mostly in local dialect. The local language was the Galilean dialect of Aramaic.

* #34: Oil press - the electricity of the day. Used for everything: light , cooking, ointments, annointing, healing. The stuff of life for that time.
* #35: Via Maris milestone. "The Way of the Seas" - the road down which the promised one would bring light to the gentiles. Jesus walked that road, it was central to commerce in the area, running from southern Palestin up around Galillee and on to Damascus. (Probably also known as the Damascus road)

* R2.#1:ancient boat from befoe 4th cen., excavated during a season of drought when the water level was very low. Now in a dehumidfying chamber awaiting preservation.

!!1:29 pm on the sea of Galilee
Jesus boat trip and service on the lake. 
*reading from stories about Jesus on the lake, walking on water, calming the storms, preaching to the people escaping (!) From the people. 
*time of prayer and silence. listening to the wind, feeling the sun, wind, rocking of the boat, feeling rocked in the hands of God. 
*took several pictures with wide angle of lakeshore and boat. 
*Landscape remeniscient of South SF Bay, hills to NE (Golan Heights) look like Diablo range

!!2pm-ish lunch
Walked from boat dock back to hotel, stopping at supermarket and picnic lunch. Bought plums earlier, pocket bread, havarti, and peach nectar with Hal and Julie.

!!3:06 pm leaving for eastern shore on bus. 
*hot springs (from bus) Tiberias had two sources of hot springs, People have come to hot springs since well before Jesus's time. Known to greeks and romans.

The Sea of Gallilee is larger now than in ancient time. Jordan river diverted twice, once by an earthquake in mid 700's, then again by a big water project. Now it is larger and parts of Caperneum and most of Magdalena are underwater.

!!Other side of the lake.

!!!Kursi 
* site of the demonic healing. "I am Legion." Gilla's Joke: "the story of the healing of the demons by going into the swine is the first recorded case of deviled ham." 
* go home and tell your friends. (Decopolis side- not the Jewish side!). Source Mark 5. (Luke 8:26-39 on sign).

* Mark writing style: in a specific situation, a conflict arisesa, Jesus intervenes, and Peace breaks out all over. 
* ancient hill town of Hippos on top and side of hill 
* 6th cen. Church & monastery built

FANTASTIC light!! Excellent golden lite shining on hills, good shadows and great brilliance.

Rabbe Akiba: Jewish scolar in 2nd cen CE. Great scolarship recorded in the talmud. Politics suppressed. Revolt against Roman Empire in 124 CE history unknown until 1964 archiological digs founds remains of the revlt and subsequent persecution. Aceptable scolarship and unacceptible politics; Jewish culture able to separate one from the other.

Really gorgeous sunset, brilliant orange glow, clouds ofering a perfect canvas, the mountains a frame.

Mark Twain wrote about his trip to Palistine. Night is the time to visit the Galilee.

Jewish comment on Sea of Gallilee: "God made many rivers, lakes and seas, but the Sea of Galilee He made for himself."

Tonight: Indian Kosher restaurant. 
*good stuff: tandoori, lamb curry, veg curry, safron rice

Aftrwards, shopping at Best Buy. Stopped at n art galery, saw a incredible artist (whosenme I don't remember now). Th style was very blocky: the people were made like wooen drawing model. Some Were very intense. Te senery as hyperreal, it is deinitely far along the style of where I have been drawing lately (starman an steroids).

Baught gifts and trinkets for the girls and Yvonne: keychains, pins, a thimble for Lola, a facial and body care kit made of minerals from the dead sea, and a gorgeious silk scarf for Y. Spent about $100. Had to put it on the `MasterCard 'cuz I didn't bring enough Trav chx with me.

Then after that, we hit the texas bar in the hotel. Carol, Julie, Liz, and John V. they had a Karioki singer who had a great voice. It was too much fun, and not quiet enough to do any journaling4 the purported reason we went there.

Purchases: 
*postcards 
*coins and stamps of Israel 
*plums 
*juice & soft drinks during the day

wierd stuff seen today: 
*The Pagoda: Kosher Chinese Experience"

!!23-OCT 0:47

Tody was the first full day of sightseeing in the Holy Land. We had a marvelous time seeing all the sites today. The feeling of being a foreign place is strong, and yet there is a sense of familiarity, too. As I read more about the are, and study the maps, I come to understand the make-up of the culture and people this land produces. I still know nothing in comparison to the available knowledge, much les what others have yet to find. And yet, I do feel a special snse of connection to this place, a sense of havingf been here, belonging here that is extremely satisfying. I donm't know what that means; I'm certainly not planning on immigrating!!

There is such a strong sense of conectedness in and with those around me of course, I've always felt this affection with Carol & dirk, Julie, and John; now I'm getting to know others as well, too (although I've been sticking close to those few. Mary Rees is fun, and it is an intersting link to know both husband Tom and middle daughter, Jennie, who's in JYF. the older guys on the trip are fun and good conversationalists. I was having an initial bad reaction to Carol & Jim Vincent, but over dinner, we warmed up. BJ was nice, but Ernie is sort of a stick and a nag. Worrying too much about money, and time. At least we have no outright complainers; nothing makes a trip go downhill faster than that! The closest we come is perhaps Chris, ut since she's not in great shape, she certainly has an excuse. She is taking car of herself, though, and isn't expecting anyone else to do for her, or resticting Ed from participating.

My roomie, john vlay,is way cool. He's funny, witty, quick with a funny comment, etc. He's accomodating as a roomate. The onlg downside is that he snores worse than I do! Cosmic fate to bring us together, no?

The experience of seeing the ancient ruins and excavations is so thrilling. It is one of the things I was really looking forward to, and I'm not at all disappointed. The sense of these ruins also strongly drives my sense of connection with this place. Unlike London, where the connection is forged on common language and direct heritage, the ruins of Israel (so far) is one of reality- not museum pieces put up for display, carfully recorded and rendered. The ruins here are where they were found (for the most part) and restore in situ. This is an important part of Iraeli governmental policy, to not bildover archiological sites.

Gota go to bed, I'm falling asleep. Pick thisup in te morning. 1:10

!!23-OCT 8:35
Taking it up again, the day yesterday was absolutely great. I loved the archiological aspects of Kursi, that was just a beautiful place. It has been restored, but not completely, to give it a remaining sense of history. I took a picture of the moon through on of the actually it was the central dome over the high altar, which was half fallen in, to create an air of mystery. I joked to myself about giving everyone a copy and telling them that they would be glad to have even a small copy when I sold the image and made a million dollars!!

Thought; Jesus Boats = Big Money in Galilee.

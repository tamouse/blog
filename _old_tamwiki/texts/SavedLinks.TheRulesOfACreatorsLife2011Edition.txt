'''[+RULES OF A CREATOR'S LIFE+] 2011/12 EDITION'''
# Do more than what you're told to do.
# Try new things.
# Teach others what you know.
# Make work into play (and vice versa).
# Take breaks.
# Work when others are resting.
# Always be creating.
# Make your own inspiration
# {+Love what you do+}, or leave.

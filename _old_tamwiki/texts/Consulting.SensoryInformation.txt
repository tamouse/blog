[[#excerpt]]
Information that relies on sensory data, such as sight, hearing, smell, feeling (internal and external) and taste. In some cases, intuition can be added here as well.

Of these, in the West, Visual (sight) is the most common sensory mode for people. As a person explores their DesiredState , make sure to find out what their [[PrimarySensoryMode]] is, and flesh out the contents of the DesiredState in that mode. But don't leave it at that. Also ask sensory specific questions in some of the other modes, to make sure they can get as rich a picture of their future DesiredState as possible.


!!Here are the names of the sensory inputs from NeuroLinguisticProgramming:

# Visual (sight)
# Auditory (hearing)
** analog: pitch, tone, timbre, etc
** digital: words, phrases, etc
# Kinesthetic (feeling)
** internalized (emotions, feelings)
** externalized (movement, touch, presence)
# Oliphactory (smell)
# Gustatory (taste)

The latter two are not used as much as the first three in most situations, but smell can be an interesting one in exploring some client's DesiredState.

Style Tiles are a design deliverable consisting of fonts, colors and interface elements that communicate the essence of a visual brand for the web.

They help form a common visual language between the designers and the stakeholders and provide a catalyst for discussions around the preferences and goals of the client.

Style Tiles are similar to the paint chips and fabric swatches an interior designer gets approval on before designing a room.¨An interior designer doesn't design three different rooms for a client at the first kick-off meeting, so why do Web designers design three different webpage mockups?

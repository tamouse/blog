Ah, lunch. The mid-day meal. Usually lighter faire in these parts. In Minnesota, it's a common thing to visit someone and hear "Would you like a little lunch?" It doesn't actually matter what time of day it is, although between 8am and 6pm usually. Before 8am it's breakfast, after 6pm it's supper (or dinner if you're uppity like that). But, lunch. Sammiches. Picnic faire. And some other things as well.

Wikipedia is a great source of information on the web. This script
grabs a summary of a wikipedia page and presents the result back to
the channel the bot was activated from.

The script uses a [[https://dgl.cx/wikipedia-dns|functionality]] that a lot of people don't know about:
someone has created a small database of wikipedia summaries that are
requested and returned via a DNS
query.

Since we're in Perl, there's a nifty Perl implementation as well:
(:source lang=perl linenum tabwidth=4 header="Getting wikipedia
summaries via DNS in Perl":)
use Net::DNS;
my $res = Net::DNS::Resolver->new;

sub wikipedia {
  my($name) = @_;
  my $q = $res->query("$name.wp.dg.cx", "TXT");
  if($q) {
    for my $rr($q->answer) {
      next unless $rr->type eq "TXT";
      return join "", $rr->char_str_list;
    }
  }
}
(:sourceend:)

The script responds to a message in a channel or a query containing:

 !wp <WIKIPEDIA PAGE>

And presents the information back to the channel or query as an
action.

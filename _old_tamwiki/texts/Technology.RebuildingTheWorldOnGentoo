[20120416|2336.10] < DouglasK> Say, is there a web page with the series of commands one uses to do a full world update on a gentoo box?
[20120416|2336.33] < tamouse__> not a gentoo person meself
[20120416|2336.45] < tamouse__> doubt my g-fu is better than yours
[20120416|2336.58]  * Oberon- hasn't mucked with gentoo in some years.
[20120416|2337.33] < tamouse__> it wouldn't be as simple as emerge world, i suppose
[20120416|2337.36] < jonored_> emerge --sync; emerge --update --deep world; revdep-rebuild; emerge --depclean
[20120416|2340.56] < jonored_> sync brings the portage tree up-to-date, --update --deep world 
                               updates to new versions of packages; revdep-rebuild rebuilds things 
                               to use the new libraries where the library updated and the thing 
                               that uses it didn't, and depclean clears out things that aren't 
                               needed anymore.

Thus:

(:source lang=bash linenum header="Full World Update on a Gentoo Box":)
emerge --sync
emerge --update --deep world
revdep-rebuild
emerge --depclean

A [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh | bokeh]] is a blur, or the quality of a blur, in a photograph of the out-of-focus elements of a picture. Most often seen with points of light that are out of focus in a photograph, they can be manipulated and designed to add appeal to the image. Here we set out to replicate the bokeh effect directly in photoshop.

!! Making a bokeh effect in photoshop 

There are a few tutorials out there for making a bokeh effect in photoshop. The one I started from is [[http://abduzeedo.com/awesome-digital-bokeh-effect-photoshop | here]].  It wasn't entirely clear from the tutorial how to achieve all the desired effects, however, so I thought I'd write a more detailed explanation of how I did it.

!!Create a new document

Create a new document, sized appropriately for your bokeh effect. Since these are often used as backgrounds, select a size large enough to accomodate your largest monitor. I selected 1600x1100 as my starting point.

Fill the background with a dark grey colour. I chose #262626 as per the original tutorial. Black won't work well in this case.

!!Create a brush to use as the bokeh

I created a new document within which to create the particular shape for my bokeh, which will be convert to a brush stroke.

Using the Elipse tool, draw an elipse on the bokeh brush document layer.

Alter the layer blending properties, via Layer>Layer Styles>Blending Options

Set the fill opacity to 50%

Set the stroke properties to Inside, 100% Opacity, 10px.

The resulting bokeh should look something like this:

Convert the layer to smart objects.

Create a new brush stroke from the object:

Give it a useful name. Select the brush tool, and select the brush you just created.

In the brush tip shape section, set the spacing to 200%:

In the shape dynamics section, set Size Jitter to 1000%, minimum diameter to 50%, Angle Jitter to 0, Roundness Jitter to 0, don't set Flip-X or Flip-Y.

In Scattering, set Scatter to Both Axes, 1000%. Set count to 4 or 5, Count Jitter to 100%:

In Other Dynamics, set Opacity to 50%, Flow to 50%:

Save and close the brush document.


!! Create the colour layer for the main document

To create an interesting colour layer for the main document, create a new layer on top of the background layer. I like to use gradients to give something interesting.

Select the gradient tool. Create a gradient or select a preset.

Apply the gradient to the layer. Mouse down and drag a rubber band in the direction you want your gradient to go. Doing it at an angle creates the most interest.

Change the layer blending mode to Overlay:

!!Create the bokeh

Create a layer group below the gradient overlay layer. Alter the blending options for the group layer. Set the blend mode to Color Dodge.

Create a layer for the first set of bokeh. Select the brush tool, and your bokeh brush. Set the foreground color to white and draw some bokeh!

Apply a guassian blur to the layer, setting the radius to 10.

Looks pretty good, neh?

Now, create some more layers and draw some more bokeh, at smaller radii:

!! Conclusion

You can of course set any shape to be a bokeh when you create your bokeh brush. Some common bokeh in photography include stars, hearts, polygons, and so on. Experiment! Enjoy!

While I'm no master chef, I've learned quite a lot about cooking over the past several decades. Here, I'm offering tips and how-tos about cooking, and things that I think are important to know.

The most important thing to know about cooking is that it is an area open to '''experimentation''' -- this is a chance to learn about new foods, and new ways to appreciate old foods. The world is a vast place with varied cuisines. You don't always have to go out for Chinese, you can make a lot of it yourself. Similarly, you don't have to get that take-out pizza when you can assemble on yourself.

Cooking is fun, no doubt about it. I hope if you're visiting here, you are a fan, or about to become a fan as much as I am.

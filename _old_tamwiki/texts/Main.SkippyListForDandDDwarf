!!Skippy's D&D Dwarf List
January 4th, 2006

[-(originally posted at http://redvsblue.com/members/journal/entry.php?id=685572, but presented here without all the stupid proprietary "smart quotes".)-]

Things Skippy the Dwarf Fighter has learned or been told while dungeon delving, or is no longer allowed to do while delving.
Dwarf Snorri Snorrison son of Snorrison's son ('Skippy' to friends and enemies alike), has been a party member of the &#34;Lost Empire&#34; campaign for several years. His adventuring behavior has been corrected from time to time, for not being appropriate for a dungeon delve. The list is almost entirely composed of The Word he was given as a response to an action or event he was involved with. 
# After the &#34;Dark Vessel&#34; adventure, everyone who ever loved me is dead. I'm not allowed to brag about that anymore. 
# Aftershave is not to be applied with a putty knife. 
# Although I do think I could do a better job and I would like to lead, these questions usually turn out not to be sincere. 
# Anything I say after &#34;it's worth noting&#34; is usually not interesting to anyone else in the party. 
# Basilisks cannot be hypnotized by winning a staring contest with them. 
# Battle axes are not the sniper's weapon of choice so I should get off the roof and engage the enemy. 
# Battle axes don't have a stun setting. 
# Clerics can move in all directions, not just diagonally. 
# Clerics that are dragged to a tavern for a night of celebratory quaffing should be returned to their devotions within 4 to 6 working days (or within two High Holy Days, whichever comes first). 
# Dark Gods require virgin sacrifices; incantations do not require virgin spell components. It is wrong to ask the mage how he knows his frog's eyes come from a virgin frog. 
# Draft horses are not missile weapons. 
# Dragon breath is not funny. 
# Dragons do not dispense their hoard in lotteries, and there's no way I &#34;may already be a winner.&#34; 
# 'Dropping Trou&#34; is not a fighter class &#34;special attack.&#34; 
# Elf ears do not require sharpening. 
# For all that he's an illiterate man, the seneschal can read me like a book. 
# For customs inspectors, &#34;Declare&#34; has a specific meaning that does not involve reciting my heritage back to the &#34;Time Of Troubles.&#34; 
# Get down off the altar. 
# Gifts from The Gods do not come with an exchange coupon for Harrod's Mercantile and Chandler shop. 
# God-calls are not protected as Free Speech. 
# He did not &#34;start it.&#34;

# He is not on &#34;my side of the dungeon.&#34; 
# He really means it this time. 
# Holy Relics of Fantastic Power do not have a shelf-life date. 
# &#34;Hungry&#34; is not an alignment. 
# Neither is &#34;stupid,&#34; but in my case, they're willing to make an exception. 
# I am not allowed to make explosives, even if I do have all the supplies. 
# I am not allowed to render any member of my party to obtain those supplies. 
# I am not the default love interest and should stay away from any non-dwarf royalty we encounter. 
# I am not the evil twin, but only because I don't have a twin. 
# I am not the Grey Poupon distributor for the kingdom, and I cannot ladle it onto the illusionist and offer him to dragons as a free sample. 
# I am not the Grey Poupon distributor for the kingdom, and I should stop giving dragons a discount on the stuff. 
# I am not the rightful heir to the Burger King, I'm just telling a whopper. 
# I cannot improve my defenses by writing &#34;-10 Armor Class&#34; on my shirt.

# I don't know what I was thinking when I said the longbowman was &#34;out of ammo&#34; after six shots. 
# I don't want you to turn this adventure around.

# I should stop writing &#34;Bite Me&#34; in orcish on my party leader's shield. 
# Must stop writing ANYTHING in orcish on party members&#34; shields. 
# &#34;I was bored&#34; is not an excuse for anything done with a loaded ballista. 
# I was not placed in charge of the prisoners so that I could slaughter them and &#34;the paladin wouldn't get his hands dirty.&#34; 
# I was not seduced by the Demon Queen of Pormax, and the scars from that adventure are not &#34;love tattoos.&#34; 
# If I sing &#34;I'm A Lumberjack and I'm Okay&#34; just one more time, they're gonna make me eat my axe. 
# If it looked like a duck, quacked like a duck, and tasted like a duck, but had a collar indicating it's sacred to a local goddess, we should skip dessert and start running. 
# In joining a group of adventurers, the party leader does actually become the boss of me, and I should respond accordingly in combat. 
# In my case, &#34;innocent until proven guilty&#34; is an offense against the gods. 
# In my case, an aphorism indicating &#34;that's when you find out who your friends really are&#34; is just noise in the wind. 
# Inquisitors have no sense of humor. They also don't like this fact pointed out to them. 
# It is wrong to greet Inquisitors by shouting &#34;stick to the story!&#34; to other party members.

# Evidently I cannot draw a clear &#34;healer&#34; to save my life. 
# It's not important who's right and who's wrong as long as the party leader is right.

# Kilroy was NOT here and he'd better stop putting graffiti in the castle. 
# Knowing how to burp fire and NEEDING to burp fire are two different things. 
# Knowing three swear words in thieves cant does not make me a dual class fighter/thief. 
# Leave the animation of the dead to professionals.

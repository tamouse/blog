In an [[http://www.boingboing.net/2005/03/16/etech_notes_feral_ro.html|article]] by Cory Doctorow at [[http://www.boingboing.net/|Boing-Boing]], he writes about a talk at the [[http://conferences.oreilly.com/etech/|2005 O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference (ETECH)]] containing the idea of Feral Robots: taking toy robotic dogs and mod-ing them so they perform useful functions.

The ETECH talk by [[http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_spkr/2042|Natalie Jeremijenko]] is: [[http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2005/view/e_sess/6310|Social Robotics, Scmocial Robotics: Feral Robotics and Some Other Quacking, Shaking, Bubbling (what would the opposite of feral be?) Robots]]

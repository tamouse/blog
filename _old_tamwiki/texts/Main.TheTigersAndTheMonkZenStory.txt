This story is rather famous:

-> A man was walking across a field when he heard a rustling in the
   tall grass beside him, and turned to see the hungry eyes of a large
   tiger staring at him. The man began to run, fear giving him greater
   speed and stamina than he knew he possessed. But always, just
   behind him, he could hear the easy breathing of the hungry
   tiger.

-> Finally, the man stopped, not because his strength had
   failed but because he had come to the edge of a high cliff and
   could go no further. "I can let the tiger eat me, or take my life
   in my own hands and jump." The man turned and saw the tiger slowly
   walking toward him, licking its mouth in anticipation. Resolved to
   take his own life, the man stepped to the edge of the cliff and
   bent his legs to jump, when he suddenly noticed a thick vine
   growing out of the side of the cliff, several feet from the
   top. 

-> Carefully, he let himself drop down the cliff face, catching
   hold of the vine as he slid past, and being thankful when it was
   strong enough to support his weight. 

-> Hanging now, the man looked up
   and saw the tiger's eyes peering over the edge of the cliff. It
   roared down at him, then began to pace back and forth along the top
   of the cliff. 

-> For the first time, the man looked at the vine that
   had saved his life. It was thick enough for him to wrap his legs
   around, resting his arms, and long enough that he might be able to
   let himself far enough down to jump safely to the ground below.

-> The moment he had this thought was the same moment that he saw the
   second tiger, pacing back and forth at the foot of the cliff,
   licking its mouth, and looking hungrily up at him. 

-> Well, thought
   the man, if my strength and the strength of the vine are great
   enough, perhaps I can outwait the tigers. Surely, they'll go
   someplace else to eat when they're hungry enough.  

-> The man
   settled in for a long wait. His preparations halted
   quickly, however, when he heard a scurrying, scratching sound close
   to his own face. 

-> Glancing upwards, he saw two mice, one white and
   one black, emerge from a small hole in the cliff. They made their
   way swiftly to the base of the vine, and began to gnaw through it
   with their small sharp teeth. There was nothing else he could do, a
   tiger above, a tiger below, and the vine that kept him from their
   jaws about to break. 

-> He was closing his eyes to begin his
   prayers, when he noticed, a little to his right, a tiny patch of
   red color on the face of the cliff. He reached toward it
   precariously, pulled, and brought his hand back beneath his
   eyes. 

-> There, in his palm, was a luscious, red strawberry. The man
   swiftly pressed the strawberry between his lips, onto his tongue,
   and hanging between those still visible tigers, he enjoyed the
   finest , juiciest, sweetest meal of his life.

!!Change the Screenshot Save File Location in Mac OS X
Mac OS X, Tips & Tricks - January 26th, 2011

[[#excerpt]]
By default, anytime you take a screen capture in Mac OS X it will save the screenshot file to the current users desktop. You can adjust where Mac OS X saves a captured screenshot to any other location, here is how to do this:
[[#excerptend]]

Launch Terminal and use the following syntax:

  defaults write com.apple.screencapture location /path/

For example, if I want to have the screenshots appear in my Pictures folder, I would use:

  defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Pictures/

To have the changes take effect, you then must type:

  killall `SystemUIServer

So the next time you take a screenshot (or as Windows converts like to say, Print Screen on a Mac), the screenshot file will appear at the location you specified.

You can change the saved screenshot location back to the default setting by specifying the desktop again:

  defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop/

Again, you’d need to kill `SystemUIServer for changes to take effect.

Video of the Year: Wild Mountain Gorillas Sniff, Kiss & Groom Man's Head, by Laura Simpson, January 17, 2012, 11:20 pm

Watch this amazing chance encounter with a troop of wild mountain
gorillas near Bwindi National Park, Uganda.  Be patient for the first
minute of the video, which is an introduction to the footage you're
about to see.  It's well worth the wait--I promise you've never
seen anything like this.

M.I.C.E. (the Mobile Intelligence and Counter-Exterminator Squad) is dedicated to saving mice and other small cute creatures from extermination around the world. This crack unit of devotee's of mice is on patrol, always at the ready to find where mousecide has occured, and to infiltrate and incapacitate rodent exterminators.

I thought it was funny, maybe I'll draw a comic strip about this, if I get some reasonable story ideas.

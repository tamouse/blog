!!Masculine Girls and Feminine Boys: Genetic and Environmental Contributions to Atypical Gender Development in Early Childhood.

''Knafo, Ariel; Iervolino, Alessandra C.; Plomin, Robert''

'''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol 88(2), Feb 2005, 400-412.'''

In this genetic study of atypical gender role development, parents of
5,799 twin pairs, ages 3 and 4, rated their twin children's
masculinity and femininity. Boys were selected as gender atypical if
they were highly feminine (top 5%, 10%, or 15%) relative to other
boys, and girls were selected if they were highly masculine relative
to other girls. Gender-atypical boys and girls were each divided into
2 groups: fully gender atypical (e.g., feminine boys also low on
masculinity) and partially gender atypical (e.g., feminine boys who
are not low on masculinity). DeFries-Fulker (DF; J. C. DeFries &amp;
D. W. Fulker, 1985, 1988) extremes analysis yielded moderate group
heritability and substantial shared environment effects for atypical
gender role behavior. However, for fully gender-atypical girls, group
heritability accounted for most of the variance, and shared
environment had no effect. The results are discussed in light of past
studies and potential implications for atypical gender
development.

!!Reinventing Your Business
by Peter Flatow, President, Co-Knowledge

The fact is all true innovation is just the reinvention of something that already exists.  Companies or individuals that are successful subscribe to a combination of the following reinvention principles.

* Be proactive.  Most managers and companies are reluctant to reinvent or renew what has worked in the past.

* Reinvent; don't repackage.  Reinvention should not be confused with minor modifications of the status quo. 

* Look beyond the present and familiar.  What drives innovation is determining where the company needs to go, not where it is.

* Use reinvention to generate added value.  There was a time when a good product was enough.  But most companies could build a good product, so successful companies added a service component.  Now product with service (or service with product) is not enough, you must add a solid experience component.

* Be willing to take some risk.  A defining difference between new-economy companies and old-economy companies is not the dot.com but the willingness to reinvent something because they have no vested interest in the status quo.  Chrysler built the first Mini-Van because they did not have a station wagon business.

This question is best asked from the ''future'' DesiredState: 

->"When you first had ''d(n)'', how did you recognize it?"

''d(n)'' represents the sequence of desired states. The current state is ''d(0)'', although most likely the current state is not "desired". It can be useful to stage the [[future desired state -> DesiredState]] in order to help the client see that what they want can be achieved in stages, and that what they want now might not be their end goal.

(:linebreaks:)
Im coming up only
to hold you under
Im coming up only
to show you wrong
and to know you
is hard we wander
to know you all wrong
we won
Ooooohh oooohh
Ooooohhhoohhhhooh
Really to late to
call so be waiting for
morning to wake you
is hard begun
to know me as hard
be goin' mad
is to know me all wrong
(be mud)
and every occasion
ill be ready for the funeral
every occasion once more
its called the funeral
every occasion
of im ready for the funeral
and every occastion
of one billion day funeral
im coming up only
to show you down fled
im coming up only
to show you wrong
to the outside of the debby
the analouge
for days and countries
hang there long
(not sure if part right)
Oooohhhohhhhhh
Oooooohooooooh
and every occasion
ill be ready for the funeral
and every occasion once more
its called the funeral
and every occasion
of im ready for the funeral
every occasion
of one billion day funeral

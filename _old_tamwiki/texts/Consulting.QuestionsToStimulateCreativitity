Wake-up, Brain ... it's Tuesday again! (long weekend ;-)
Brought to you by the Innovation Network

We had so many great responses to the request for questions to stimulate
creativity that we're going to send them in batches.  Here's the first
group:

From: Debbie Baker <d.baker@NOSPAMix.netcom.com>
I don't have five.  I have 2 which work well for me.
1 If there were no time or money limitations what would you do?
2 When people tell me they don't know what to do, I ask
"If you knew what to do, what would it be?"

From: Phyllis Van <pavan@NOSPAMinav.net>
Two of my favorites:
1 What do you want that you don't have now?
2 What, if it were invented tomorrow, would put you out of business?

From: DAVID_STRAKER@NOSPAMHP-UnitedKingdom-om1.om.hp.com
Starting from Kipling's What/When/Why/Where/Who/(How):
1 What have you done today that you have never done before?
2 When are you next going to do something different?
3 Why are you not doing or thinking something different '''right now'''?
4 Where are you going on your holidays? (go somewhere '''different''')
5 Who have you helped think differently today?
6 How can you become even more creative?

(I know you said 5, but I decided to break the rule!)

From: John M.Trebes <affable@NOSPAMc-com.net>

* These three questions, in their specific form only came to me late
  in my 35 year engineering career in the Space business. How I wish
  they had been trained into from early on, and continuously
  thereafter.

1. Give me five different ways that this (device, item, item) can be "broken".

Not only will one become more intimately acquainted with the "item" than
they have ever been before, they will now be faced with the challenges to
to exercise their "creativity" coming up with ways to re-design the "item"
to keep it from being broken in ways they have never thought of before.
(Note:  I only heard this challenge stated openly as I reached the end of
my career in the Space business.  We, collectively were doing this, though
not with the conscious intent of discovering ways to break an item.  We
did test items extensively to see if they would perform within the
boundaries of a set of specifications as contrasted to looking for ways
the item could be broken by 'surprise or the unexpected source".)

2  "Now that you have your (problem statement, mission statement, etc)
give me ten 'assumptions' implicit in the (problem statement, mission
statement, etc)."

3  Create a five or ten minute "lesson plan", and present it,  on how you
would teach this concept to" a grade school class and a high school class.
(Note: I have been asked this and I did it.  It was a memorable
experience. I profited greatly from this experience.)

From: Mike <gj1335@NOSPAMhotmail.com>
1 How do YOU think we should do this?
2 What would make this work more fun AND faster?
3 If you had my job, what would you do differently?
4 How would YOU recommend we improve quality?
5 If this were "the last minute" would you do this assignment
differently?

From: serge serge@NOSPAMcistron.nl
I am really curious to see the answers.
My suggestions:
1 "In how many ways can we ....". The classic brainstorm question.
2 "This is a really difficult problem and I am sure many other
organizations have to deal with it. Can you address this problem?" In
this way you instantly rise above the case itself, suggesting looking for
references, (improving on) proven methods, and a recognition that the
work to be done is not trivial.
3 "... Solve this problem. Forever." Now it's obvious somebody wants this
solved very badly. And you give every freedom to do it.

From: Rolf Smith <thinking@NOSPAMonramp.net>
Two of my favorite questions to get people thinking about thinking...
1 What's something you don't know?
2 What's a thought you've never thought before?

From: Mark Smith <marks@NOSPAMmsi-uk.com>
Tony Robbins poses some powerful questions which can help ignite
creativity:
1 "What is great about this problem?"
1 "How can I use this (situation, challenge etc) to improve ...?"

My favourite is:
1 "What would I do, if I knew I couldn't fail?"



From: "Giampoli, Debra" <dgiampoli@NOSPAMkraft.com>
Here are some questions I might ask my staff if I were trying to inspire
them to be more creative:

* What might we do that would create "buzz value" among our customers
and competitors?
* How would Disney approach this challenge?
* How many other ways could we think about this?
* What might we do if money, time, and politics were no object?
* How many ways can you think of to reframe the challenge?
* What outcome would you be really proud of at the end of this
project?
* What outcome might create an audible "WOW" in the organization?

From: Vanda North <VANDANORTH@NOSPAMcompuserve.com>
The questions I would ask are:
1 "What do you need to make  (X) it happen?"
2 "There are limitless resourses, now, what will you do?"
3 "If you were Leonardo da Vinci, how would you manage it?"
4 "They say this is impossible, and that we certainly can not do
it.................??!!"
5 "Go where-ever you relax best, and see what pops into your
mind?!"

From: Bob Barlow <rbarlow@NOSPAMfrontiernet.net>
In the introduction to my book, Bob Barlow's Book of Brain Boosters
(Scholastic), I thank my late father for posing the question that sparked
my lifelong love of creativity. I was about five years old when he looked
me in the eye and asked, "Bob, how do you throw away a garbage can?"

Dad wasn't looking for an answer, of course; there is no "right" answer.
He just wanted to get me thinking -- which he did -- and that has made
all the difference. Bob Barlow, sixth grade teacher.

From: Anne Robinson <anniecreate@NOSPAMhotmail.com>
Five possible questions which would get me going.  Might
not others.
* If you could make any change you want in your current situation or
assignment what would it be?
* What setting would be most inspirational for you if you were asked
for a really creative idea?
* How would you remove worry and fear of failure from your mind and
replace them with what William Miller calls "a flash of brillilance"?
* How can you stretch your mind without leaving your brain hanging in
long gray loops?
* What gift would you seek from seven specific geniuses to enhance
your own creative powers?

From: Bob Phillips <expsoln@NOSPAMpreferred.com>
Here are some questions that have proved useful to me in the past (my
career was in Industrial Innovation).
1 How else might we solve this problem or take advantage of this
opportunity?
2 How else might we define the problem/opportunity we face?
3 How can we polish this "diamond in the rough"?
4 How would you describe the feelings of "aha" that you have
experienced?
5 Who else can help us with our problem?

From: Dale M. Parish <IE_DMP@nospamHAL.LAMAR.EDU>
1 What is it that '''I''' (manager) do that I can stop doing that would
help you feel less restricted.
2 What is it about the work environment here that you believe keeps
people from offering their suggestions.
3 What can we do together to take the limits away for solving
this/these problem(s).
4 Whom in this department do you feel is the least receptive to change
that could be moved to a position where they could be happy in doing
non-creative work?
5 What structure can I create as department manager to make the others
in this department really believe that their most outlandish suggestions
would be given a fair shake?

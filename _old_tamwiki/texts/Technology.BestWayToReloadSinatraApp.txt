Q: What is the best way to run a modular Sinatra app to have it reload with each request? * Martin Streicher 16 Jan 13 | 3:38 am

A: There are many ways. I used 'rerun' gem. It need not be part of the package. I have had my share of problems with sinatra reloader and guard. * Sairam 21 Jan 13 | 12:12 pm

A: Hi Martin, I've used Sinatra Reloader like so:  * Darren Jones 23 Jan 13 | 2:25 pm


(:source lang=ruby linenum:)
require "sinatra/base"
require "sinatra/reloader"

class MyApp < Sinatra::Base
  configure :development do
    register Sinatra::Reloader
  end

  # Your modular application code goes here...
end
(:sourceend:)

You need to remember to register the extension when building a modular style app. It has worked fine for me so far

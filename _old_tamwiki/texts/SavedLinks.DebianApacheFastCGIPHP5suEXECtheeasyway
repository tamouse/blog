There are literally hundreds of tutorials and howtos to be found on the web that purport to walk the budding sysadmin through configuring a web server in the best way possible. Many of these extol the benefits of running PHP through CGI under suEXEC or adding suPHP to the mix so PHP scripts run with the same permissions as the script owner. These lists of instructions wind on for pages and pages with little to no explanation as to what the procedure is doing to your precious server and are very often out-of-date or tailored for a different operating system than they claim. The purpose of this guide is to provide a concise, clear, and up-to-date tutorial on installing Apache 2.2 and FastCGI-based PHP 5 under suEXEC on a modern Debian installation. It assumes some pre-existing familiarity with *nix-based systems and Apache virtual hosts.

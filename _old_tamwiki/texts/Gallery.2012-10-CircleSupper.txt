On October 20, 2012, we hosted the monthly potluck of the &ldquo;Church of the Circle Supper&rdquo;. We had one of our good friends, Sandy, bring along her keyboard and harp to entertain us. It was my parents' 60th wedding anniversary, my birthday, Ed's birthday, and various other celebrations. A fun time was had by all!

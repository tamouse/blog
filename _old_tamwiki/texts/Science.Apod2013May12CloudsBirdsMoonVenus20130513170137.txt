''' Explanation: ''' Sometimes the sky above can become quite a show. In early September of 2010, for example, the [[http://bb.nightskylive.net/asterisk/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=21078 | Moon and Venus converged]], creating quite a [[http://apod.nasa.gov:80/ap100516.html | sight]] by itself for [[http://apod.nasa.gov:80/ap050913.html | sky enthusiasts]] around the [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5DqY_q86xQ | globe]]. &#65533; From some locations, though, the sky was even more picturesque. In the above image taken in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain | Spain]], a crescent Moon and the planet Venus, on the far right, were captured during sunset posing against a deep blue sky. &#65533; In the foreground, dark [[http://apod.nasa.gov:80/ap080122.html | storm cloud]]s loom across the image bottom, while a white [[http://apod.nasa.gov:80/ap040218.html | anvil cloud]] shape appears above. Black specks dot the frame, caused by a [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81wFZavdhPU | flock of birds]] taking flight. Very soon after this picture was taken, however, the birds passed by, the storm ended, and Venus and the Moon set. &#65533; Bright Venus again [[http://www.astronomy.com/News-Observing/Sky this Month/2013/03/Bright planets meet at dusk.aspx | becomes visible]] just after sunset this 2013 May and will appear near Jupiter toward the end of the month.

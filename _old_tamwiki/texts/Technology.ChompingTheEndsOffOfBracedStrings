[[#excerpt]]
I noticed that when there is nothing passed in an args paramter (a catch-all parameter that sucks up the rest of the parameters in a proc call), it contains the string "{}". This is an actual string, not a braced expression. To get rid of those, and to be able to treat args as a regular string, the following seems to work:

  [=[string range $args 1 [expr {[string length $args]-2}]]=]

This removes the first character and last character from the string (strings are basically zero-based).

(:Summary:When args are delivered to a proc in TCL, they might be contained in braces. Here's how to deal with that.:)

!!Making requests for what you want
[[#excerpt]]
In order to get the things you want, often you have to request things of someone. This can also be used for self-directed actions, i.e., you are making requests of yourself.

'''Presupposition:''' both parties are willing to negotiate to a consensus.

'''Presupposition:''' the intention of both parties is to produce (realize) the outcome.

'''Presupposition:''' all behavior is the result of an initial good intention from the point of view of actor.

An '''outcome''' is often divided into two parts: a '''request''' and a '''commitment''' are two halves of a whole '''Conversation For Action''' (a concept put forth by Terry Winograd of Stanford University). The purpose of the conversation is to have a person make a request of another person, the second person commit (or promise) to fulfill the request.

* a '''request''' is in the form of a question
* a '''commitment''' is in the form of an assertion

!!Canonical Request Form:

-> "I request that you perform ''X'' delivering ''Y'' by time ''T''"

!!Canonical Response Forms:

One of:

# "I accept."
# "I decline."
# A counteroffer to negotiate the specifications of ''X'', ''Y'', and ''T''. "I can't do ''X'' but I can do ''X&#39;'', by date ''T&#39;''. Is that ok?"
# A commitment to a future commitment ("I can't tell you now, but I'll get back to you about it on ''date''."

All requests require a response; there is no such thing as silence equals agreement. The opposite is the case: if no response is made, the requestor should consider the request declined.

The [[well-formedness of the outcome / request / commitment -> WellFormedOutcomes]] is the result of the full and independent commitment of both parties agreeing to and having, or being able to aquire, the resources, skills and knowledge to achieve the outcome / request / commitment. Each party is completely and independently responsible for the [[well-formedness -> WellFormedOutcomes]] of the outcome / request / commitment.

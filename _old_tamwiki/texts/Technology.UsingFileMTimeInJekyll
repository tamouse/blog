[[#excerpt]]
[[Jekyll]] posts include the publication date in their file name, and
are published under that in the destination folder. By default, the
date is taken from the file name, or from the @@date:@@ field in the
post's front matter.

However, sometimes you'll want to edit a post, updating some info,
correcting a broken link, adding something new from comments, etc. In
this case, you might want to also indicate the current version of the
file.
[[#excerptend]]

This could be done a few ways. This particular way will use the file's
modification time (mtime).

In this case, we'll be using a [[Liquid]] filter, which lets us do the
following in our site files:

(:source lang=html5  tabwidth=2  :)
<ul>
  <li class="meta">Published on: {{ page.date }}</li>
  <li class="meta">Last modified on: {{ page.path | file_date | date_to_rfc822 }}</li>
</ul>

!! Plugin

Create a file to hold the plugin code in the @@_plugins@@ directory of
your source directory (creating it if necessary). Add the following to
that file:

(:source lang=ruby linenum tabwidth=2 header="_plugins/file_date.rb" :)
module Jekyll
  module MyFilters
    def file_date(input)
      File.mtime(input)
    end
  end
end

# this is necessary to tell Jekyll to use the filter.
Liquid::Template.register_filter(Jekyll::MyFilters)

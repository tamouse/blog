In the latest revision of Mountain Lion (it may have showed up earlier, but I just noticed it now), instead of getting a key repeated when you hold it down, a little menu pops with alternate characters (accents chars, etc) to select instead of the one you just typed.

If you really don't like this behaviour, you can change it by entering the following into a Terminal.app window:

(:source lang=bash:)
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
(:sourceend:)

To reverse it and restore the press and hold feature, simply flip the false to true above:

(:source lang=bash:)
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true
(:sourceend:)

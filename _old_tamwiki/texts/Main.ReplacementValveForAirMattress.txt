If you have attempted all the solutions found on the Troubleshooting Section without success or if your valve is damaged (e.g., the tab has broken off), please complete the form below to receive a new valve. You must provide all the information noted below to ensure accurate delivery of your replacement valve. Most importantly, you must provide us with the full name of the product that requires a new valve. Some of our products have a code to identify the product. The code is a combination of letters and numbers found on a round sticker on the pump included with your bed (see example at right). If your product has this code, please enter it in the space below so that we can send you the correct valve for your model. If you do not have a code sticker, the full name of the product should be sufficient.

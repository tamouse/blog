[[#excerpt]]
Tool Control Language (TCL) and Tcl Toolkit (Tk) are a pair of useful tools for putting together small programs and driving other programs. The unix expect program is based on Tcl, and the IRC bot program eggdrop uses Tcl for its scripting language. Other IRC clients also make use of Tcl.

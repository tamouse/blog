From a long-lost e-mail correspondent:
-> "I do know that whenever there is an identity theft, one of the very first things one needs to do is notify the three major credit bureaus so they can flag your ssn. My brother was a victim of ID theft and, due to his situation, had to go to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to file a criminal report. They actually caught the guy. Hopefully this helps."

For California residents concerned about '''becoming''' victims of identity
theft, you may want to consider putting a "freeze" on your credit.

Difference between a "fraud alert" and a "security freeze" (aka 'credit
freeze')

>>faq<<
Q: What is the difference between a fraud alert and a security freeze?

A: A fraud alert is a special message on the report that a creditor receives
when checking a consumer's credit rating. It tells the creditor that there
may be fraud involved in the account. A fraud alert can help protect you
against identity theft. A fraud alert can also slow down your ability to get
new credit. It should not stop you from using your existing credit cards or
other accounts.

* Experian: The fraud alert tells creditors to verify the identity of the person applying for credit.
* Equifax: The alert tells the creditor to call the consumer at a given phone number before issuing new credit.
* Trans Union: The alert may say either to verify identity or to call the consumer at a given number.

A security freeze means that your credit file cannot be shared with
potential creditors, insurance companies or employers doing background
checks. Most businesses will not open credit accounts without checking a
consumer's credit history first

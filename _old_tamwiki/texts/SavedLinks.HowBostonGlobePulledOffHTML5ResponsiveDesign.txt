On Monday, The Boston Globe released its new premium content mobile initiative dubbed BostonGlobe.com. That is not to be confused with Boston.com, its free flagship website. This unto itself is not all that interesting. Yet, the HTML5 development community is heaping praise on BostonGlobe.com primarily for how the sites renders across varying screen sizes, an innovation called responsive design.

Responsive design allows the Globe's content to be refitted to any screen size available automatically. It is a win in the fight against mobile device fragmentation and screen sizes and the future of how content is displayed on mobile devices. Below is an in-depth discussion with the creators of the Globe's responsive design and the challenges they faced along the way.

>>quote<<
Finally, to the young girl I've seen only in my imagination, my someday daughter:

I hope that by the time you grow up, things will have changed.

If they haven't, and you find yourself being treated poorly, marginalized, objectified and idealized, infuriated, ignored, shoved aside, held to a double standard, emotionally blackmailed, taunted and insulted, overlooked and under-appreciated, your wishes dismissed, your gender reduced to a vulgarity, slut-shamed and resented, I hope you will still keep your head high and pursue your dreams.

When it comes to choosing when to use the @@[[http://us.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.switch.php|switch]]@@ control structure, vs. a chain of @@if-elseif-else@@ statements, there are many opinions. Many find chains of @@if-elseif-else@@ statements to be crude and ugly. That said, sometimes there is no alternative. Fortunately, in PHP and Perl, there usually are alternative. The @@switch@@ control structure is remarkably flexible in what it can do.

!!Let's compare

A typical cascading @@if-elseif-else@@ structure:

(:source lang=php linenum:)
if ($result == 'image/jpeg') {
    $ext = 'jpg';
} elseif ($result == "image/gif") {
    $ext = "gif";
} elseif ($result == "image/png") {
    $ext = "png";
} else {
    $ext = "dat";
}
(:sourceend:)

Whereas, if we were to use a @@switch@@ statement, we'd get:

(:source lang=php linenum tabwidth=2:)
	switch ($result) {
		case 'image/jpeg': $ext = "jpg"; break;
		case 'image/gif': $ext = "gif"; break;			
		case 'image/png': $ext = "png"; break;			
		default: $ext = "dat"; break;
	}
(:sourceend:)

Which seems more elegant and readable to you? I tend to vote for the @@switch@@ implementation over the cascading @@if-elseif-else@@ structure.

!!Another alternative

While the above example shows the difference plainly between @@if-elseif-else@@ and @@switch@@ statements, there is actually a better alternative in this case: a lookup table.

Somewhere in your source, create a lookup table:
(:source lang=php linenum:)
$mapmimetoextension = (
    'image/jpeg' => 'jpg',
    'image/gif' => 'gif',
    'image/png' => 'png',
    # ... and so on
);
(:sourceend:)

Then, to determine the extension given the mimetype, you could simply do:
(:source lang=php linenum:)
$ext = isset($mapmimetoextension[$mimetype] ? $mapmimetoextension[$mimetype] : 'dat';
(:sourceend:)

Which seems a lot cheaper than either the cascading @@if-elseif-else@@ or the @@switch@@. Given the desire to keep code modular, it would also likely save on a procedure call.

That's fine for PHP, what about Perl?

!!Perl Switch Constructs

Unlike some other programming languages, Perl has no official switch or case statement. That's because Perl doesn't need one, having many ways to do the same thing. A bare block is particularly convenient for doing case structures (multiway switches). Here's one:

(:source lang=perl linenum:)
SWITCH: {
    if (/^abc/) { $abc = 1; last SWITCH; }
    if (/^def/) { $def = 1; last SWITCH; }
    if (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1; last SWITCH; }
    $nothing = 1;
}
(:sourceend:)

and here's another:

(:source lang=perl linenum:)
SWITCH: {
    /^abc/      && do { $abc = 1; last SWITCH; };
    /^def/      && do { $def = 1; last SWITCH; };
    /^xyz/      && do { $xyz = 1; last SWITCH; };
    $nothing = 1;
}
(:sourceend:)

Both of these constructs operate on matching the @@$_@@ variable. I prefer the second form (no nasty if's going on there. Note that the both forms can be much more convoluted there. There is no need to necessarily restrict one's self to making comparisons with the @@$_@@ variable. Basically ''any'' test can be made in the case portion of the switch construct. 

What makes this work is the @@last SWITCH;@@ statement. It basically quits the switch when it is executed.

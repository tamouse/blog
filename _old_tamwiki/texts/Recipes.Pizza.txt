!!Introduction
I '''''LOVE''''' pizza, love it to death. I am probably addicted to it, in fact. I like pizza hot, cold, room temperature, new, old (well, not ''too'' old), american[^Anything goes, especially in the arena of gourmet pizza^], european, neopolitan[^Thin, no meat, just sauce, tomatoes and cheese; sometimes olives^], australian[^Put an egg onnit, mate!^], you name it, if I've been somewhere, I've had pizza there. Even when I went to Thailand with a friend, they had Pizza Hut! Although Thai is probably my ''second'' favourite food, I'd rather eat Thai food in Thailand than Pizza Hut Pizza in Thailand. {$SiSmiley}

Here are some recipes featuring pizza. It's so easy to make! {-I used to have a great recipe for pizza dough, I hope I can find another like it or better.-} {+'''FOUND!!''' CaerLlewysCookbook has a recipe that is so close to the one I used to have that it might even be the same!+}

!!Enhancing Store-bought frozen and fresh pizza
You know, I'm not above buying a frozen or uncooked pizza, such as from Papa Murphy's. But I don't just leave it as it's packaged. Even the most mundane frozen pizza can be improved upon. Typically I add:
* Basil
* Oregano
* Ground Pepper
* Garlic powder
* Mushrooms
* For my folks, I'll put black olives on their part, but I'm not having anything to do with them!

On occasion, I'll even throw on:
* Chopped sun-dried tomatoes
* Chopped, cooked bacon
* Chopped onion (vidalia, red, yellow)
* Extra cheese (mozarella, monterey jack, parmesean)

Some people like marinated artichoke hearts, but I'm allergic to them.

'''''No fish!!''''' (if you want anchovies on ''your'' pizza fine, but I'm not sharing it) (Fish include any kind of sea food: anchovies, mackeral, salmon, shrimp, lobster, clams, oysters -- I'm having none of it!)

Caer Llewys (Lion's Den) is the home name of my friends Cymru and Alaric and their three kids (as well as a sprinkling of hangers-on and such). They're serious geeks, and serious gourmets. Their cookbook is a collection of the things they've tried (and it's HUGE) and found successful. The cookbook lives at: http://www.caerllewys.net/public/recipes.pdf and is `GPLed.

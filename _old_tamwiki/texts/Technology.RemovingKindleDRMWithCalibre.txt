'''Calibre Plugins: The simplest option for removing DRM'''

# You must already be able read your ebooks, either on your computer or on your ebook reader. (Kindle, nook, etc.) If you cannot read your ebooks on your computer or on your ebook reader, you won t be able to remove the DRM. Contact your ebook retailer and sort out any problems reading your ebooks before trying to remove the DRM. 
# Download and install the latest [[http://calibre-ebook.com/ | calibre]] for your Operating System. 
# Download the latest [[http://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/2010/02/11/hello-world/ | combined tools package]], and unzip it. (On Windows, right-click and Extract All ; After extracting all, rename the tools_vX.X.zip to backup_tools.zip to prevent later confusion) 
# Run calibre. Click Preferences. Do '''NOT''' click Get plugins to enhance calibre , that option is reserved for official calibre plugins. Instead select Change calibre behavior Then under Advanced click on Plugins. (looks like a puzzle piece) 
# Click on the large Load plugin from File button 
# Navigate to the tools folder unzipped in step 2 
# Open the Calibre_Plugins folder 
# Select one of the zip files in that folder 
# Click on Add (or the button may say Open ) 
# Click on the Yes button in the warning dialog that appears. A Confirmation dialog appears that the plug-in has been installed. 
# Repeat steps 4 to 9 for every zip file in the Calibre_Plugins folder (five at present). 
# You must now configure the plugins. Which plugins need configuring, and the information you need to enter depends on what kind of ebooks you have. If your ebooks don t match the description at the start of any of the following items, ignore it and move on to the next. \\
\\
To configure a plugin, you must find it in the list of plugins. All the DRM removal plugins are in the File Type plugins section of the Plugins section of the calibre prefereces. Click on the plugin in the list to select it, and then click on the Customize plugin button. In the dialog that then pops up, enter the required information, detailed below.

## %item alpha% If you have Mobipocket ebooks, where you either entered a PID on the retailer s web site, or you must read them in Mobipocket Reader, you must enter the PID you entered on the retailer s web site, or the PID of your installation of Mobipocket Reader into the customisation field of the K4MobiDeDRM plugin. The PID will be ten numbers and letters, with * or $ as the eighth character. If you have more than one PID, enter them separated by commas, 
## %item alpha% If you have Amazon Kindle ebooks that were downloaded to your Kindle, you must enter your Kindle s serial number into the customisation field of the K4MobiDeDRM plugin. If you have already entered a PID there, add the Kindle serial number as well, separating it from the PID with a comma. Please note: all PIDs and Kindle Serial Numbers are '''case-sensitive'''. 
## %item alpha% If you have Amazon Kindle ebooks that were downloaded to the copy of Kindle for Mac or Kindle for PC that was installed on this computer, you do not need to add anything extra into the customisation fields. 
## %item alpha% If you have ePub ebooks that can be read in Adobe Digital Editions, you do not need to add anything extra into the customisation fields. 
## %item alpha% If you have PDF ebooks that can be read in Adobe Digital Editions, you do not need to add anything extra into the customisation fields. 
## %item alpha% If you have ePub ebooks from Barnes and Noble (e.g. for nook), you must enter your name (NOT YOUR E_MAIL ADDRESS) and full credit card number into the customisation field of the Ignoble Epub DeDRM plugin. The name and credit card number should be the ones set as part of the Credit Card unlock code on your Nook Library page. Separate the name from the number with a comma '''and do not put any spaces in the card number or around the comma.''' 
## %item alpha% If you have eReader ebooks from Barnes and Noble, or from, say, Fictionwise, your must enter your name and the last 8 digits of your credit card number into the customisation field of the eReader PDB 2 PML plugin. Again, the name and credit card number must be the ones entered at your ebook retailer s website as the DRM key/Unlock code. 
## %item alpha% If you have ebooks bought at the Apple iBooks store, you need to find and use Requiem 3.3 or later by Brahms. It is NOT part of the tools package. 
## %item alpha% If you have Microsoft LIT ebooks, there is no Calibre plugin that can remove the DRM.

# Now click on the Apply button, and then close the preferences.

You are now ready to remove the DRM from your ebooks. Just import them into calibre, and the DRM will be removed. The plugins ONLY remove the DRM when the ebooks are imported. If you have already imported your ebooks into calibre, your will need to remove them and import them again.

[Alan] has co-authored several best selling guidebooks for amateur astronomers, including, with Terence Dickinson, The Backyard Astronomer’s Guide, reprinted and revised in 2010 (Firefly Books). He is also author of several children’s book on space, notably Insiders: Space and Mission to the Moon, both for Simon and Schuster. A new kids book about Stars is due out in 2011. I also contributed sections to National Geographic’s Backyard Guide to the Night Sky.

[Alan] is a frequent guest expert on local and national news media. As an amateur astronomer, his interests include astrophotography and deep-sky observing (he compiled some of the popular deep-sky observing lists in the annual RASC Observer’s Handbook).

Alan takes the opportunity as often as possible to visit the southern hemisphere to pursue both observing and photography under southern skies. His other obsession, eclipse chasing, has taken him to every continent, chalking up 13 total solar eclipses — #14 will be in Australia in 2012. Asteroid 78434 is named for him.

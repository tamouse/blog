** Arguably more useful, although sometimes it's hard to find exactly what you're looking for if you don't already know the package name: [[http://search.cpan.org | Search CPAN]]
** Another useful CPAN search: [[http://metacpan.org | Meta CPAN]]
* [[http://perlmonks.org | Perlmonks]] -- there are lot of good tutorials and information about the ''right'' way to code in perl.
* [[PerlSphere -> http://perlsphere.net/]] -- perl blog aggregator. Watch here for interesting tidbits. All the kool kids posts end up here.

* [[Get the head of a web page -> GettingTheHeadOfAWebPage#perl]]

There's just a metric boatload of stuff out there about perl. I can't possibly provide all the goodies.

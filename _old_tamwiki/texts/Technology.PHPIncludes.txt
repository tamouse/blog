[[PHP]] is a wonderful language to use for all sorts of things, not
just web applications. One of it's great features is the ability to
include other php scripts in the main script. This can lead to some
interesting application architectures.

!!The include family

There are 4 types of include mechanisms:
* include
* include_once
* require
* require_once

These all do similar things, but there are some differences.

* The _once directives will faithfully only allow you to include a
  file one time during the run of the script, thus saving you from
  having to worry about including something more than once in
  different scripts if they use the same features.

* The difference between the include* and the require* directives is
  subtle. Require will issue a compiler error and fail if the file is
  not found in the [[#includepath | include path]], whereas include will issue a warning
  and continue.

Generally speaking, unless you are going to provide your own error
handlers, on a production application that is open to users, you
probably don't want to use require*, and use include* instead to
provide graceful degredation if the features in the included script
are not available. This is much preferrable than presenting a
completely blank page to the user.

[[#includepath]]
!! The Include Path

PHP will search it's include path to look for the filespec given in
the directive. This include path is set in the
[[http://us.php.net/manual/en/ini.php| [@php.ini@] ]] file in the
[[http://us.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.include-path | [@include_path@] ]]
entry. PHP will search this path, then look in the calling scripts
directory and finally the current working directory. (This can make for
some interesting patterns in include directives.)

!!Common code, utilities, modularization

The most frequent application of includes is to include other parts of
the application. Any code that is used in multiple places or
applications should be written as a separate chunk of php and included
in the application. This is very appropriate for libraries of reusable
code, and also for modularizing an application. It's quite a
maintenance nightmare to have to wade through an application script
that is miles long and having functions and variables all over the
place.

In particular, doing object-oriented programming is when to make good
use of includes. Your class is nicely enclosed in it's own php file
which you can include in your main and then instantiate an object of
that class.[^It would be awesome for php to have class autoloaders, and [[so it does -> http://us.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php]]. ^] 

!!Single entry, with functions dispatched via includes

In this model, there is a single entry script, say index.php, for
example.[^There may be reasons '''not''' to name the single entry script index.php. If you're creating an application that will be distributed and installed, giving it a proper name may make it easier for people to upgrade your application, and to affect any sort of customizations they may want on their own directory index file.^]
The
single entry script will use include or one of it's siblings to pull
in the various pieces of code to run the application, perhaps
including certain files only if the current conditions warrant it.

This is a classic way of creating a controller for an
[[ModelViewControllerParadigm|MVC]] architecture. The controller pulls
in the appropriate models to execute functions, then pulls in the
approprate views to display the output. All this can easily be done
with includes.

!!Silly uses of includes

The include directives really have no notion of what it is they're
including, they just do something interesting if the file is not there
or is unreadable, otherwise they pass the contents of the file into
the php interpretter. Thus, they don't do any sort of checking to see
what is being included. Thus, you can do some silly sorts of things,
like this:

(:source lang=php:)
<?php
header("Content-type: image/jpeg");
include("image.jpg");
(:sourceend:)

This will work because the php interpretter is looking for instances
of "<?php" and "?>" to do anything, which won't appear in the binary
image file.

However, it's best ''not'' to do these sorts of shennanigans as it
will be hard on the person coming back to maintain and fix something,
should that occur[^that person might even be ''You!''^] 

The way to handle to above is to use [[http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.readfile.php | [@readfile@] ]] 
instead:

(:source lang=php:)
<?php
header("Content-type: image/jpeg");
readfile("image.jpg");
(:sourceend:)

Readfile does not pass anything to the compiler, it simply reads from
the file specified and sends the output to the client directly.

What you’re about to read is borrowed largely from Christopher Seiwald’s article, [[“The Seven Pillars of Pretty Code.” -> http://www.perforce.com/perforce/papers/prettycode.html]]. In a nutshell, the Seven Pillars are:

* Being “bookish”
* Making alike look alike
* Overcoming indentation
* Disentangling code blocks
* Commenting code blocks
* Decluttering
* Blending in with existing style

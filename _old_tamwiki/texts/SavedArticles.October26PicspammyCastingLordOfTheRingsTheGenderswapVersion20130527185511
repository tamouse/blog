! Picspammy: Casting Lord of the Rings, the genderswap version

When I created this picspam, I had a couple of requirements when choosing an actor. First off: they should be of an approximately fitting age. No 20-year-old Aragorn or 40-year-old Gandalf. Second off: they should have some tie to the movie version of the character, as that's what I'm casting after. As I'm pretty bad at actors, I used IMDB extensively and asked friends for help. I haven't considered much beyond looks either, as, well, then I couldn't cast anything. Not much of a movie watcher, me. :)

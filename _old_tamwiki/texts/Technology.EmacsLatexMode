!!Introduction
[[#excerpt]]
[[ {{LaTeX}} -> Technology.LaTeX ]] is a fabulous mark-up language for
creating all kinds of documents, from simple to complex, that is
mostly intended for typeset works. (There are tools to convert
{{LaTeX}} to HTML, but if you are doing dual-deployment, it may be
better to start off from a different, but common format that can be
converted into either.)

!!my-latex-mode
@@latex-mode@@ is invoked on a file by the
[[usual means -> EmacsModes]]
and has some pretty nice features. I like to use the @@pdflatex@@
toolchain for running {{LaTeX}} on my files, but this also presents a
problem with the standard @@tex-view@@ and @@tex-print@@ functions, as
they ''hard-wire'' in the need for a @@.dvi@@ file. I wrote a file
that can be loaded whenever @@tex-mode@@ or @@latex-mode@@ is invoked
via the standard Emacs [[hooks -> EmacsUsingHooks]] mechanism.

The file creates a new set of customisable variables and functions
geared toward handling `PDFs instead of @@.dvi@@ files. The keyboard
commands normally associated with @@tex-view@@ and @@tex-print@@ are
remapped to these new functions.

!!! New variables:

:@@tex-pdf-print-command@@:Command used to print a pdf (default: "xpdf")
:@@tex-alt-pdf-print-command@@:An alternate command to print the pdf (default: "xpdf")
:@@tex-pdf-view-commant@@:Command used to view a pdf
** X Windows default: "xpdf"
** MS Windows default: "acroread"
** Non-specified: "open" ''(this is mostly used for OS/X.)''

!!! New functions:

:@@tex-pdf-print@@:Prints the pdf created
:@@tex-alt-pdf-print@@:Alternative method for printing the pdf
:@@tex-pdf-view@@:View the pdf

!!! Obtaining my-latex-mode

:Repository:https://gitorious.org/latex-stuff/my-latex-mode

Clone the repository into a temporary directory, then move
@@my-latex-mode.el@@ to a directory on your @@emacs@@ @@load-path@@.

!!! Installing my-latex-mode

Modify your @@.emacs@@ file with the following:

(:source lang=lisp:)
(add-hook 'latex-mode-hook (require 'my-latex-mode))
(:sourceend:)

Then, whenever you load a latex file, these functions will also be
available. The file remaps the [@C-c C-v@] and [@C-c C-p@] keys to use
the new pdf functions.

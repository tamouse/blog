>>quote<<
Static HTML pages have obvious advantages - Fast loading, easy to write, less load on the server, lower bandwidth costs, search engines prefer static pages over dynamic ones ( generally speaking ).

Dynamic pages have their own set of advantages - Automatic refreshing of content ( news, sidebar updates, etc. ), capability to interact with the user ( web query forms, data output, ecommerce applications, etc. ).

But I want to have the best of both worlds. I want to have a static HTML page, which is served out of a database, and will refresh itself automatically at pre-specified intervals. How is this done?

Answer: Simply, wrap your code in output buffering and save it to a file:

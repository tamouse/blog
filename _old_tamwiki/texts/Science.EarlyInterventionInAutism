:Excerpt:Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are typified by impaired social-communication skills. Children and adolescents with ASD have difficulty understanding, interacting and relating with others.

->New research suggests intensive therapy, especially at early ages, can help children achieve the best outcomes.

->The intensive therapy helps children with autism improve social and communication skills, say the leaders of a current study.

->"It's important for children with autism to begin treatment as soon as possible," said clinical psychologist Dr. Micah Mazurek, assistant professor in the Department of Health Psychology at the University of Missouri. "The more intense or comprehensive the therapy, the better it is in terms of helping children improve social and communication skills."

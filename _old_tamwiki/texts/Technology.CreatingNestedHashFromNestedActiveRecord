!! [Rails] Creating nested hash from nested active record results

Hello,

I'm trying to find a very abstract and "one size fits all" for
converting nested active record results to nested hashes.   It's easy,
to do one level deep as such:

(:source lang=ruby:)
results_to_hash = Hash[ found_categories.map{ |c| [c.id, c.title]}]
(:sourceend:)

But, when I try to add another collection to the mix, it completely
borks and the results_to_hash only returns an empty hash IE:

(:source lang=ruby:)
results_to_hash = Hash[ found_categories.map{ |c| [c.id, c.title, c.categories]}]
(:sourceend:)

Ultimately, I'd like it to be smart enough to detect if a model object
contains a collection (IE: [@object.class.reflect_on_all_associations@]),
and automatically convert those to hashes.


Any ideas?

Thanks,
Eric

Would this work?

(:source lang=ruby:)
MyModel.last.serializable_hash methods: MyModel.reflections.keys
(:sourceend:)

Or is that too much?

Look at the options that you can pass into [@serializable_hash@].

However, if you are doing this for json/etc. serialization in the controller, check out [@ActiveModel::Serializers@].

One note about this: this can hit n+1 queries pretty hard. Unless you put include: in your associations (which I wouldn't not recommend unless it makes sense, and it probably doesn't) you have to know at query time what to include (or use joins), and what I just posted would make that difficult.

If you do use [@ActiveModel::Serializers@] instead and have big serialized objects, look at yodo to help you identify the value for include: in your queries to avoid n+1:

You could also look at bullet in that regard:

We'll start today's sightseeing with a visit to the Garden Tomb, with time for worship, reflection and meditation. We will visit the Garden of Gethsemane and the Church of all Nations, then drive across the Kidron Valley to the Old City. We'll visit many of the most important Christian sites here including part of the Via Dolorosa, the Christian Quarter, the beautiful Church of St. Anne, the Pool of Bethesda, Pilate's Judgment Hall and the Ecce Homo Arch. We'll try to arrange a time to sing in St. Anne's church with its beautiful accoustics.

This afternoon we'll travel to Bethany, where Mary, Martha and Lazarus lived. Then on to visit Bethlehem where we will see Manger Square, the Church of the Nativity and a view of Shepherd's Fields and the Fields of Boaz and Ruth. We'll visit Bethlehem Bible College, which trains ministers and now also trains Arab guides.

Return to Jerusalem for dinner and overnight in Jerusalem

pm Depart for Israeli Folkloric show at the YMCA.

!!26-OCT Journal

7:36 in hotel: restructured the journal, to save batteries and time and space. Lost Journal for 10/25. 8:40 on the way to Bethlehem.

The hotel in jerusalem is not as good as the one in Tiberias. The wall is from 1530, and was built by the Ottomans. (I thought it was strange that a first century wall would have crenellations.

A rainy day to start. It doesn't look loke it will last.

For some reason today, I'm feeling rather negative. It started off, I'm sure with the meal last night, then the lateness of this morning, accompanied by losing a days worth of journaling, then rushing through breakfast, and then, no stamps available.

Driving around the old city. We see the various gates. We went by the spot where the pilgrim tunnel was recentlyopen. Luckily, the Muslems have decided that they would use Soloman's stables fo peayer. This is a good compromise solution, since by making it a holy place wil mean that it will be kept for prayer and not other things.

Word for the day: "RESPONSIBILITY"
*what does it mean to be responsible on vacation?
*my own learning
*personal growth
*recording my experiences, thoughts and feelings
*making sure others are getting their full share, not taking too long causing others to miss seeing things
*thanking others for making themselves available for taking pictures, taking time to listen

10:06 at the church in Bethlehem marking the spot where Jesus was born.
*a beutiful orthodox church contains the grotto, with the star of bethlehem marking the consecrated birth spot. A small chapel marks a spot where the crusaders built a manger. 
*a mass was being conducted as we were touring through, so we were unable to spend much time in the grotto as we would have liked. It was also difficult to see mucho anythin and realy beabl to tak tins in well. 
*a special treat was a youth coir which sang a couple of songs in the Catholic church next door. 
*we went down into the grotto from the Catholic church side, which is under the Orthodox grotto. There we had a small gathering, sang some Christmas songs. 
*we got to back down to the grotto under the Orthodox church to light our candles and sing another song 
*outside, another set of encounters with peddlers. They were able to change a travlers check for $20. Bot a bad exchange rate. 
*traffic is bad in Bethlehem today. There is a city bus strike, and the drivers were clogging traffic in the heavily travelled spots. The parking lot at the birthsite churches was full of them.

Bethlehem is a Palestinian city, so there is a checkpoint between Bethlehem and Jersalem.

There were moments of reverence, or at leasyt attempts at them. I am still feeling pissy today, I have to let go of that feeling and enjoy myself.

The singing today was deeply moving. The youth choir was fantastic; their voices were fresh, strong, and quite pure. Our own singing was also inspiring, as we celebrated Jesus's birthplace with songs of his birth.

The churches were very beautiful, esp. the orthodox church, with its icons, chandeliers, silver and gold leaf. There were mosaics on the floor.

!!12:58 after lunch
Lunch was light, mediterranean salads and pocket bread,

I am still feeling a bit melancholy. The stop before lunch was at another tourist shop ths one specializing in olvewood sculpture. I was pretty annoyed at the stop, but there are lots of others on the trip who like shopping, so I go along. I would really like to get something for Suzie, but I haven't found anything special, yet. Maybe one of the pictures I bought.

!!13:04 on the way to Bethany

Gilla describing the Menorrah, Zaccharaia 4:1-10 ; a vision of the seven lamps surrounding the glowing ball, two olive trees surrounding it are the annointed ones who stand on each hand of God. The seven lights are the eyes of God.

Responsibility: 
*taking control of myself in the grotto. 
*Jesus taking responsibility for our sins. 
*Joseph taking in Mary and Jesus. 
*the Orthodox and Catholic churches taking joint responsibility for the birth site. 
*Gilla taking us to a fast lunch place.

Purchases: 
*2 post card packets, 6 shekkels 
*a cow for nancy, key ring pens for the Girls, $9 
*lunch, $7

afternoon.

Garden tomb, Golgotha means skull. The church of St. Anne's, Mary's mother.

20:28 Jerusalem Folkloric Show

tthe show was great. Much different than I anticipated. I guess I was expecting something a little more amatuerish, but this was quite professional. It was like 'riverdance' only Israeli instead of Irish.

Afterwards, we took a field trip to see the King David Hotel, where all themajor dignitaries stay. The picture wall had all the recent presidents from Nixon onwards, as well as other dignitaries.

Bethlehem Bible College is run by long-time Christian Arabs. We will look forward to learning their experience and seeing their work in Bethlelem. Alex Awad is a Methodist minister there.

The Folkloric show showcases all kinds of Israeli and ethnic dances -- very colorful and fun.

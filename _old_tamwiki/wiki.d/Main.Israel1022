We had a marvelous time seeing all the sites today. The feeling of being a foreign place is strong, and yet there is a sense of familiarity, too. As I read more about the are, and study the maps, I come to understand the make-up of the culture and people this land produces. I still know nothing in comparison to the available knowledge, much les what others have yet to find. And yet, I do feel a special snse of connection to this place, a sense of havingf been here, belonging here that is extremely satisfying. I donm't know what that means; I'm certainly not planning on immigrating!!%0a%0aThere is such a strong sense of conectedness in and with those around me of course, I've always felt this affection with Carol & dirk, Julie, and John; now I'm getting to know others as well, too (although I've been sticking close to those few. Mary Rees is fun, and it is an intersting link to know both husband Tom and middle daughter, Jennie, who's in JYF. the older guys on the trip are fun and good conversationalists. I was having an initial bad reaction to Carol & Jim Vincent, but over dinner, we warmed up. BJ was nice, but Ernie is sort of a stick and a nag. Worrying too much about money, and time. At least we have no outright complainers; nothing makes a trip go downhill faster than that! The closest we come is perhaps Chris, ut since she's not in great shape, she certainly has an excuse. She is taking car of herself, though, and isn't expecting anyone else to do for her, or resticting Ed from participating.%0a%0aMy roomie, john vlay,is way cool. He's funny, witty, quick with a funny comment, etc. He's accomodating as a roomate. The onlg downside is that he snores worse than I do! Cosmic fate to bring us together, no?%0a%0aThe experience of seeing the ancient ruins and excavations is so thrilling. It is one of the things I was really looking forward to, and I'm not at all disappointed. The sense of these ruins also strongly drives my sense of connection with this place. Unlike London, where the connection is forged on common language and direct heritage, the ruins of Israel (so far) is one of reality- not museum pieces put up for display, carfully recorded and rendered. The ruins here are where they were found (for the most part) and restore in situ. This is an important part of Iraeli governmental policy, to not bildover archiological sites.%0a%0aGota go to bed, I'm falling asleep. Pick thisup in te morning. 1:10%0a%0a!!23-OCT 8:35%0aTaking it up again, the day yesterday was absolutely great. I loved the archiological aspects of Kursi, that was just a beautiful place. It has been restored, but not completely, to give it a remaining sense of history. I took a picture of the moon through on of the actually it was the central dome over the high altar, which was half fallen in, to create an air of mystery. I joked to myself about giving everyone a copy and telling them that they would be glad to have even a small copy when I sold the image and made a million dollars!!%0a%0aThought; Jesus Boats = Big Money in Galilee. %0a

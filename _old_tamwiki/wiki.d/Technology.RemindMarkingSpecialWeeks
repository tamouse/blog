text=[[#excerpt]]%0aRemind is an extremely powerful, but syntactically-challenging tool. I've no doubt one could create any date specification to get events to work correctly. Setting things up for month-long and week-long events is one of those things.%0a[[#excerptend]]%0a%0a!! Month-long events%0aAt least in the US, we seem to designate somethings as "National X Month" or "National X Week".

The ''%25m'' variable gives the current month in the output. In addition, the ''%25_'' variable causes a new line.

It&#65533;s quick to light, fast to boil and clean to use. ||By converting heat from the fire into usable electricity, our stoves will recharge your phones, lights and other gadgets while you cook dinner. ||Like a campfire, you can sit around the CampStove and watch the flames dance as you roast marshmallows and tell stories with friends. ||By using renewable resources for fuel instead of petroleum, you're reducing your carbon footprint. You'll also keep fuel canisters out of the landfill. ||The CampStove isn't just for camping; it's great to have on hand when the power goes out in a storm or other natural disasters. You'll be able to cook and keep electronics charged while power lines are down. ||Half the planet cooks on open fires, leading to 2 million premature deaths each year and contributing to global warming. We're using the same technology inside the CampStove to bring clean, safe energy access to families across the developing world. || || ||||%0a> |||| cellpadding="2" width="100%25" ||||%0a> ||http://shop.biolitestove.com:80/assets/templates/common/images/spacer.gif ||||%0a> |||| width="100%25" |||| width="100%25" ||Customer Reviews || [[http://shop.biolitestove.com:80/# | View All Reviews]]|| |||||||| |||| cellpadding="4" width="100%25" || http://shop.biolitestove.com:80/assets/templates/common/images/star5.png ||'''Unbelievable performance! Now for the real tests.''' || || ||Reading all the other glowing reviews set my expectations high. But I was still absolutely amazed by the performance. I figured I would burn through a big bundle of twigs just trying to get the pot warm. Surprise, surprise! Lit instantly, hot in 1 minute, 3 cups of boiling hot water a few minutes later. And with barely a handful of twigs I kept it boiling hard for about 10 minutes. It gets it's real trial next week at scout camp, followed by 10 days canoeing in Maine. I'll keep you posted. || || ||''Reviewed by: William Howard from Central Mass.

I took it to the Sierra mountains this weekened, and had a hot bowl of soup at 12000 feet beside a glacial lake. Took less than 15 minutes to collect a handfull of twigs and bark, toss in one long-burn match, hit the switch and bring a pan of soup to a boil. I let it charge my kindle while I ate, and then waited about 30 minutes for it to cool down enough to clean out and pack back up. Truly genius. || || ||''Reviewed by: David Aitken from Rimforest CA.

It&#65533;s quick to light, fast to boil and clean to use. ||By converting heat from the fire into usable electricity, our stoves will recharge your phones, lights and other gadgets while you cook dinner. ||Like a campfire, you can sit around the CampStove and watch the flames dance as you roast marshmallows and tell stories with friends. ||By using renewable resources for fuel instead of petroleum, you're reducing your carbon footprint. You'll also keep fuel canisters out of the landfill. ||The CampStove isn't just for camping; it's great to have on hand when the power goes out in a storm or other natural disasters. You'll be able to cook and keep electronics charged while power lines are down. ||Half the planet cooks on open fires, leading to 2 million premature deaths each year and contributing to global warming. We're using the same technology inside the CampStove to bring clean, safe energy access to families across the developing world. || || ||||%0a%3c |||| cellpadding="2" width="100%25" ||||%0a%3c ||http://shop.biolitestove.com:80/assets/templates/common/images/spacer.gif ||||%0a%3c |||| width="100%25" |||| width="100%25" ||Customer Reviews || [[http://shop.biolitestove.com:80/# | View All Reviews]]|| |||||||| |||| cellpadding="4" width="100%25" || http://shop.biolitestove.com:80/assets/templates/common/images/star5.png ||'''Unbelievable performance! Now for the real tests.''' || || ||Reading all the other glowing reviews set my expectations high. But I was still absolutely amazed by the performance. I figured I would burn through a big bundle of twigs just trying to get the pot warm. Surprise, surprise! Lit instantly, hot in 1 minute, 3 cups of boiling hot water a few minutes later. And with barely a handful of twigs I kept it boiling hard for about 10 minutes. It gets it's real trial next week at scout camp, followed by 10 days canoeing in Maine. I'll keep you posted. || || ||''Reviewed by: William Howard from Central Mass.

I took it to the Sierra mountains this weekened, and had a hot bowl of soup at 12000 feet beside a glacial lake. Took less than 15 minutes to collect a handfull of twigs and bark, toss in one long-burn match, hit the switch and bring a pan of soup to a boil. I let it charge my kindle while I ate, and then waited about 30 minutes for it to cool down enough to clean out and pack back up. Truly genius. || || ||''Reviewed by: David Aitken from Rimforest CA.

BioLite gets extra points in my book for smart eco-friendly packaging. I can honestly say the BioLite CampStove has exceeded my expectations. It&#65533;s a great little stove; burns hot and clean on a handful of twigs. It&#65533;s so efficient that it only left a couple tablespoons of ash.

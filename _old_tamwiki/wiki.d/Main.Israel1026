We will visit the Garden of Gethsemane and the Church of all Nations, then drive across the Kidron Valley to the Old City. We'll visit many of the most important Christian sites here including part of the Via Dolorosa, the Christian Quarter, the beautiful Church of St. Anne, the Pool of Bethesda, Pilate's Judgment Hall and the Ecce Homo Arch. We'll try to arrange a time to sing in St. Anne's church with its beautiful accoustics.%0a%0aThis afternoon we'll travel to Bethany, where Mary, Martha and Lazarus lived. Then on to visit Bethlehem where we will see Manger Square, the Church of the Nativity and a view of Shepherd's Fields and the Fields of Boaz and Ruth.

We see the various gates. We went by the spot where the pilgrim tunnel was recentlyopen. Luckily, the Muslems have decided that they would use Soloman's stables fo peayer.

One lived in a marsh. where there was plenty	 of water, which frogs love: the other frog lived in a lane some	distance away, where all the water to be had was that which lay in the	ruts after a rain. The Marsh Frog warned his friend and pressed him to	come and live with him in the marsh, for he would find quarters there	far more comfortable and - what is still more important- more safe.	But the other refused, saying that he could not bring himself to move	from a place in which he has become accustomed. A few days afterward a	heavy wagon came down the lane, and he was crushed to death under the	wheels.%0a%0aIf a frog comes to the edge of your rut and tells you of a new and	different place what would you do ?

But creating and sharing knowledge is essential to fostering innovation, the key challenge of the knowledge-based economy. To create a climate in which employees volunteer their creativity and expertise, managers need to look beyond the traditional tools at their disposal. They need to build trust. The authors have studied the links between trust, idea sharing, and corporate performance for more than a decade. They offer an explanation for why people resist change even when it would benefit them directly. In every case, the decisive factor was what the authors call fair process--fairness in the way a company makes and executes decisions. Fair process may sound like a soft issue, but it is crucial to building trust and unlocking ideas.%0a%0aSubject/Keyword: Creativity Decision Making Human Behavior Innovation Management of Change Management of Professionals Motivation Organizational Change%0a%0aLength: 11p%0a%0aSource: HBR%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a

The book goes into considerable depth on how it works, and presents many examples of manipulating the object model to good use. The format of first section of the book goes through a week of a pair of Ruby programmers as they try to fix and refactor an existing application, and how they use various metaprogramming "spells" (techniques, idioms, etc). The second section is a set of essays talking directly to the reader, rather than talking about people working on something.

Not only does this give a sense of "reality" to the descriptions, it also gave me a sense of the inherent mutability of the model. How easy to quickly erase and write a new segement of a drawing on a white board; the issue of "this is set in stone" is completely eradicated by this technique, which reinforces the flexible nature of Ruby's object model.%0a%0aWhile metaprogramming itself can be a touchy subject ("how much is too much?" "how do you test and maintain it?" "how do you convey what you're doing to someone picking up your code" and so on), it is such a useful thing to know. At the end, the author offers up the opinion that, in fact, metaprogramming is just programming, after all, with all the goodness and badness that can result from that if you don't pay attention to what you're doing, and more importantly, ''why'' you're doing it. %0a%0aI '''very strongly''' recommend this book to Rubyists, and to others who want to discover how and why the language works as it does.

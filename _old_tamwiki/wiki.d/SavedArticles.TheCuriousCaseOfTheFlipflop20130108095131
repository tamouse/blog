Instead, it acts as a "flip-flop" operator, a feature carried over from archaic text processing languages such as awk, sed and [[http://perl.about.com/ | Perl]]. Though it is a Range analog, of sorts.%0a> %0a> But first, a warning. The flip-flop operator is a hotly contested feature of Ruby. It's still struggling to find an [[http://ruby.about.com:80/od/gl/g/Idiom.htm | idiomatic]] use case, except for a few very rarely needed things. It's not something you'll likely reach for on a daily, weekly or even monthly basis. The only thing you really need to know about it is what it does, and that's only in case you encounter it in someone else's code. Many even go as far to say not to use the flip-flop operator, that it only adds confusion. The choice is yours though.%0a> %0a> These types of flip-flop expressions look at bit different. First, they're usually in the conditional portion of an [[http://ruby.about.com:80/od/beginningruby/a/loopconditional.htm | if]] or [[http://ruby.about.com:80/od/rubyfeatures/a/loops.htm | while]] statement. Second, the left and right of the Range expression itself are usually boolean expressions. For, for example, it might look something like this.%0a> %0a> (:source lang=ruby:)%0a> if a==3 .. a==5   # Do something end%0a> (:sourceend:)%0a> %0a> %0a> The flip-flop expression will [[http://ruby.about.com:80/od/control/a/Boolean-Expressions.htm | evaluate]] to false until the first (left hand) expression is true. The flip-flop expression will then evaluate to true until the right-hand expression evaluates to true. It will then continue to evaluate to false until the left-hand expression evaluates to true again, and then it will flip the other way. It flips and flops between the true and false state, hence the name "flip-flop."%0a> %0a> The flip-flop expression can also be exclusive. With the typical double dot version, when the second expression evaluates to false, the flip-flop expression will evaluate to true that one last time. When using the three dot notation, the flip-flop expression will evaluate to false as soon as the second expression evaluates to false.%0a> %0a> So how is this a "range analog" as was mentioned before? In the example above, assuming @@a@@ is a range of 1 to 10, the flip-flop will be true from the values of @@a@@ from 3 to 5 (including 5). In addition, if there are any additional 3's in the sequence, it will also be true for any future sequence of 3 to 5.%0a> %0a> !! Usage%0a> %0a> Describing how to use the flip-flop operator can be tough. Firstly, it's not used very often. In fact, many say not to use it at all.

Say you want to print all lines from a text file starting with the line that begins with @@BEGIN@@ and ends with the line that begins with @@END@@.

For example, you have the range of numbers from 1 to 100 and you way to select only the numbers between a multiple of 5 and the next highest multiple of 8. So from 5 to 8, then from 10 to 16, then 20 to 24, etc. Your first try might be something like this (but it would be wrong).%0a> %0a> (:source lang=ruby:)%0a> (1..100).select{|i| i%255==0 .. i%258==0 }%0a> (:sourceend:)%0a> %0a> %0a> This looks reasonable, so why is it wrong?

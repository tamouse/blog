The man began to run, fear giving him greater%0a   speed and stamina than he knew he possessed. But always, just%0a   behind him, he could hear the easy breathing of the hungry%0a   tiger.%0a%0a-> Finally, the man stopped, not because his strength had%0a   failed but because he had come to the edge of a high cliff and%0a   could go no further. "I can let the tiger eat me, or take my life%0a   in my own hands and jump." The man turned and saw the tiger slowly%0a   walking toward him, licking its mouth in anticipation. Resolved to%0a   take his own life, the man stepped to the edge of the cliff and%0a   bent his legs to jump, when he suddenly noticed a thick vine%0a   growing out of the side of the cliff, several feet from the%0a   top. %0a%0a-> Carefully, he let himself drop down the cliff face, catching%0a   hold of the vine as he slid past, and being thankful when it was%0a   strong enough to support his weight. %0a%0a-> Hanging now, the man looked up%0a   and saw the tiger's eyes peering over the edge of the cliff. It%0a   roared down at him, then began to pace back and forth along the top%0a   of the cliff. %0a%0a-> For the first time, the man looked at the vine that%0a   had saved his life. It was thick enough for him to wrap his legs%0a   around, resting his arms, and long enough that he might be able to%0a   let himself far enough down to jump safely to the ground below.%0a%0a-> The moment he had this thought was the same moment that he saw the%0a   second tiger, pacing back and forth at the foot of the cliff,%0a   licking its mouth, and looking hungrily up at him. %0a%0a-> Well, thought%0a   the man, if my strength and the strength of the vine are great%0a   enough, perhaps I can outwait the tigers. Surely, they'll go%0a   someplace else to eat when they're hungry enough.  %0a%0a-> The man%0a   settled in for a long wait. His preparations halted%0a   quickly, however, when he heard a scurrying, scratching sound close%0a   to his own face. %0a%0a-> Glancing upwards, he saw two mice, one white and%0a   one black, emerge from a small hole in the cliff. They made their%0a   way swiftly to the base of the vine, and began to gnaw through it%0a   with their small sharp teeth. There was nothing else he could do, a%0a   tiger above, a tiger below, and the vine that kept him from their%0a   jaws about to break. %0a%0a-> He was closing his eyes to begin his%0a   prayers, when he noticed, a little to his right, a tiny patch of%0a   red color on the face of the cliff. He reached toward it%0a   precariously, pulled, and brought his hand back beneath his%0a   eyes. %0a%0a-> There, in his palm, was a luscious, red strawberry. The man%0a   swiftly pressed the strawberry between his lips, onto his tongue,%0a   and hanging between those still visible tigers, he enjoyed the%0a   finest , juiciest, sweetest meal of his life.%0a

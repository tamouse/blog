text=[[#excerpt]]%0aI came across this list of rules. It's used by a computer group but it fits very well with any other loose-knit organization that stays in contact via email. It's worth a read but if you use it, note the copyright requirements at the end:%0a%0ahttp://bad.debian.net/shotgun_rules.txt%0a[[#excerptend]]%0a%0a[NOTE: This list of rules is a general template for defining in-person meetings of loosely-connected email lists without a central organizing authority. To use it, replace the markers "{name-of-list}" with the name of your email list or group, and change the date recurrence in rule 1. Publish the modified rules on your email list or Web site.%0a%0aYou can and should remove this note, but not the copyright notice at the end of the document.]%0a%0a!!Shotgun Rules For {Name-Of-List} Meetings%0a%0a:Rule 1: Each {week|month}, the {name-of-list} meeting will be on {the 2nd Wednesday of the month|Sunday night|the 4th|full moon|whenever}.%0a%0a:Rule 2: Determination for the location for the {name-of-list} meeting is like calling shotgun for the front passenger seat of a car. Whoever calls the location first, wins, and that's where {name-of-list} is going to be, period. In case of close calls, "first" is determined by date received by the list server machine, and ties go to the runner.%0a%0a:Rule 3: A meeting announcement must be posted by email to the {name-of-list} list, with the word "ANNOUNCEMENT" in the Subject header. It must define a time, a location (with address and/or directions by car and public transportation), and use the declarative voice ("We are going to..." not "Would you guys like to go to...?"). It should not be sent before the previous {week|month}'s meeting has happened (or should have happened).%0a%0a:Rule 4: If you make the announcement, you have to go, you have to be on time and preferably early, and you have to make a little sign that says "{name-of-list}" so people know where they're supposed to sit.%0a%0a:Rule 5: If no one makes an announcement, the meeting will not happen. If nobody cares enough to take responsibility and make an announcement, and everyone minces around with do-you-think's and what-about-this's, we are weak and cowardly and do not deserve a lovely meeting together.%0a%0a:Rule 6: Nobody is making you go to {name-of-list} meetings. Your dialysis machine is not at the {name-of-list} meeting. You are not a robot of the future who will be stuck in our dimension forever if you don't attend the {name-of-list} meeting.%0a%0a->If, for some reason, you cannot make it to the {name-of-list} meeting, or you don't like where it's being held, or Chinese food gives you an upset tummy, then Don't Go, and make a note in your calendar to yourself to take some initiative and make the next month's announcement.%0a%0a:Rule 7: In case of SEVERE HAZARD -- for example, the originally chosen venue has burnt to the ground or is on fire at the scheduled time for the meeting, etc. -- the original organizer should post a new announcement according to rule 3, mentioning prominently that it is a change.%0a%0a->The organizer MUST put a sign and/or a human runner at the original venue to send people who missed the revised announcement to the new location.%0a%0a----%0a%0aThat's it. 7 simple rules. The Date Rule, the Shotgun Rule, the Email Rule, the Organizer Rule, the Have a Spine Rule, the Take Your Lumps Rule, and the System Crash Rule.%0a%0aNow, as another reminder, here's the non-binding part.%0a%0a!!Good locations for a {name-of-list} meeting will have:%0a%0a* Food%0a* Cheap food%0a* Good food%0a* Alcoholic beverages%0a* Non-alcoholic beverages%0a* Access for minors and people under 21%0a* Separate checks%0a* Seats for 10-30 people%0a* Room to push tables together, or pull them apart%0a* Forgiveness for people coming and leaving at will%0a* Something for vegetarians to eat%0a* Something for carnivores to eat%0a* Enough quiet that we can talk%0a* Enough loudness that we're not a big distraction%0a* Enough light that we can see the network diagrams we're drawing on the backs of napkins%0a* Access by public transportation%0a* Access by car%0a* Nearby parking%0a* Easy directions%0a%0aObviously, there's no requirement that every location have all these things, and most locations won't. And you are the sole determiner of where everyone goes: you can call the meeting for a XXX movie theater or your own home or a cardboard box under the freeway. But it'd be nice to meet these goals.%0a%0a* Restaurants and cafes that have been historically supportive of our cause deserve our business and dollars.%0a%0a* A good time for meeting is A) late enough that people can get off work and drive or ride from their region to the region the meeting is in, and B) not so late that the place is going to close, or people have to go home for sleep. Think 7-8PM.%0a%0a* If you think you know a good place to go, announce it. If you don't, shut up. When people post do-you-think's and what-about-this's, it clouds the waters and everyone gets confused. So don't do that.%0a%0a* If for some reason you are far outside the preferred region of the meeting, you should think about starting an offshoot group and having separate meetings.%0a%0a* A good meeting attendee will bring money for their share of food and drink if they can. If they can't, they will keep their grubby mitts off the food and drink. If they share from common food or drink (such as pizzas or fries or pitchers of beer), they will get up and get another pizza or basket of fries or pitcher or whatever when the current one runs out.  They will chip in for what they ate, and pay for what they ordered, and remember the tip, and round up rather than down.%0a%0a* A sample announcement email would look like this:%0a%0a(:source lang=email -getcode:)%0aFrom: Evan Prodromou %3cevan@NOSPAMdebian.org>%0aTo: bad@NOSPAMbad.debian.net%0aSubject: ANNOUNCEMENT: B.A.D. Meeting For April 2002%0aDate: 24 Mar 2002 08:31:11 -0800%0a%0aThe B.A.D. meeting for this month will be held at Munster's Pizza%0aParlor on April 10th, 2002 at 1313 Mockingbird Lane in Berkeley at%0a7:30PM.%0a%0aMunster's is at the corner of Mockingbird and Yourtown Street on the%0aNumber 17 AC Transit line. It is a 2 block walk from the Northside%0aBART station.%0a%0aI will be organizing a PGP key-signing. If you want to participate,%0aplease send me your OpenPGP public key by noon on April 10th.%0a%0aSee you there,%0a%0a~ESP%0a(:sourceend:)%0a%0a-> Note that this message projects authority, it has all important information, and it does not use a question mark anywhere in the  message or subject line.%0a%0a* There is no shame in announcing the meeting for  someplace that  {name-of-list} has already been before. Heck: if  it was good enough  before, it's probably good enough now.%0a%0a* If you make an announcement, it's entirely  possible that NO ONE will  come. This is the risk you run. You have put  yourself on the line,  and it's within the realm of likelihood that you  will spend the  night lonely and afraid, standing naked in the  rain while fire ants  crawl on your legs and chomp your skin and all of  the people you  have ever had secret crushes on point at you and  laugh and laugh. \\ \\ In short, it will be the worst night of your entire life, bar  none. If you are prepared for this, any other  outcome will be icing on the cake. \\ \\ If you are not prepared for this, and you send a vituperative and  bitter email to the {name-of-list} list on the Day  After, you will  come off like a fool, and you will have capped  your disastrous event  with a bitter and ugly conclusion. This is not  smart, so don't do  that.%0a%0a%0a-------------------------------------------------------------------------%0a%0aCopyright (c)  2002  Evan Prodromou.%0a%0aPermission is granted to copy, distribute and/or  modify this document  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation  License, Version 1.1 or  any later version published by the Free Software  Foundation; with no  Invariant Sections, with no Front-Cover Texts, and  with the Back-Cover  Texts being this copyright notice.

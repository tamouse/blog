This along with doing good work is how we gain the trust and respect of colleagues, bosses, and clients—something every design professional aspires to. And it’s why all these little pieces of communication we constantly deliver are so important.So what’s so hard about communication, and how can we get better at it?%0a%0aGood question. We communicate constantly among our teams, both in person and remotely. The question hinges mainly on trust.%0a%0aInayaili goes on to say some really important things, including:%0a%0a->'''People need human contact and interaction to flourish.''' ...digital communication makes us miss all the benefits that come from communicating to while being in someone’s physical presence:%0a-->''The human moment ... is a regulator: when you take it away, people’s primitive instincts can get the better of them. Just as in the anonymity of an automobile, where stable people can behave like crazed maniacs, so too on a keyboard: courteous people can become rude and abrupt. (Fram [[http://hbr.org/1999/01/the-human-moment-at-work/ar/1 | The Human Moment At Work]] by Edward M. Hallowell, HBR, Jan 1999)''Digital communication removes all the cues that mitigate worry. As more and more people work like [we] do, alone from home offices, without much face-to-face interaction, it’s important that we’re aware of this both in ourselves and others.%0a%0aThe answer lies, obviously, in getting face-time with the people you work with. As a consultant, I found this to be tremendously true. Initial meetings with clients (beyond the logistical setting-things-up stage) were always face-to-face. This firmly established each other as real, credible people, with full "3-D" effects. Subsequent visits were necessary to gather high-fidelity information that would also be seen as credible in the results we were to give. Remote conversations could happen more easily and with better confidence among all parties because we had already established the relationship via in-person contact.%0a%0aInayaili goes on in the same vein:%0a%0a->One answer comes from 37signals, which hires great talent regardless of geography and encourages others to do the same. In their book [[http://37signals.com/rework/ | Rework]], founders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson report that meeting in person is important for remote teams.%0a%0aThe article goes on to make some extremely important points about first accepting that humans are largely ''emotional'' creatures, and make stunning ''connections'' between events that may have no connection, and ''invent (or hallucinate)'' events and connections that never happened. The importance of meeting people can dispell at least some of the "us-vs-them" mentality that is engendered when individuals and groups are dispersed; it doesn't get rid of all of it, and if the meetings do not cause the dispersed members to come together, or ''gel'', it can actually further the rift. Such are the dangers of so-called "Team-Building Activities".%0a%0aWhat's vitally important in these sorts of meetings is not that everyone get to say their piece, but that everyone go in with an expectation of ''understanding'' everyone else. This changes the dynamic from one of "I'm going to tell them what's so" to "I'm going to find out what they think and see if we can agree". Obviously this is precarious, because it's not ever guaranteed that this is going to work. The opposite, though, never works, unless the point is to break up the team.%0a%0aInayaili talks about this process:%0a%0a->Instead of showing your work to your colleagues with a few mumbled words and a shrug and expecting them to get its sheer brilliance, it’s important to involve them from the start, making everyone feel invested and part of the solution. Map out the future you see in front of you, and make them walk the same journey.%0a%0aVery highly recommended.

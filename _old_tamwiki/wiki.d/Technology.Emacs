text=[[#excerpt]]%0aEmacs has been my text editor of choice since probably about 1985 or%0aso when I first started working on unix systems. I had come from using%0athe screen editing capabilities of old HP terminals that were able to%0abuffer up the contents of their screens and send it all at once to the%0acomputer they were attached to. Emacs represented the first departure%0afor me from that where the editing was actually being done directly on%0athe computer upstream from the terminal.%0a[[#excerptend]]%0a%0aAs such, Emacs is the editor I "imprinted" on and as such it is the%0aone I use to judge my experience of all other editors. Time and again,%0aI've tried different text editors only to go back to Emacs. My most%0arecent departures from Emacs have been using Eclipse at a job where I%0awas writing Java, and `TextMate on OS X which I used extensively in my%0aweb development work. I have been doing the majority of my work on my%0amacbook pro, and so `TextMate was quite a natural choice, although I%0astill did some work in Emacs on the mbp as well.%0a%0aNow, I'm switching back to Linux-based development for the most part,%0aso `TextMate is right out in that regard, so it's back my beloved%0aEmacs again.%0a%0aHere are some things I've been recently getting into Emacs to make my%0adeveloment experience better. There are some really nifty features of%0a`TextMate that aren't built directly into Emacs in the standard%0adistribution configuration.%0a%0a[[#links]]%0a!!Links%0a* [[GNU Emacs manual -> http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/]]%0a* [[Emacs Wiki -> http://emacswiki.org]]%0a* [[emacs-fu blog -> http://emacs-fu.blogspot.com]]%0a* [[Basic MH-E setup with nmh, fetchmail and msmtp -> http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MH-E#toc5]]%0a* [[Installing Emacs 24 on Ubuntu 12.04 -> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1999720]]%0a** [[Emacs24 on Savannah -> http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/]]%0a%0a[[#linksend]]%0a%0a%0a(:if false:)%0aSummary:the kitchen sink editor that thinks it's an operating system%0aParent:(Technology.)Tools%0aIncludeMe:[[Technology.Tools]]%0aCategories:[[!Articles]], [[!Collections]], [[!Links]]%0a(:tags-hide emacs, text editors, tools, editors, linux:)%0aTags: emacs, text editors, tools, editors, linux%0a(:if:)%0a

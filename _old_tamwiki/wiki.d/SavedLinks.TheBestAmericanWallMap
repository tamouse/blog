Nearly 6,000 hours in total. It would be prohibitively expensive just to outsource that much work. But Imus' 35-year veteran of cartography who's designed every kind of map for every kind of client - did it all by himself. He used a computer (not a pencil and paper), but absolutely nothing was left to computer-assisted happenstance. Imus spent eons tweaking label positions.

But Imus' map uses thick lines to indicate state borders and reserves the color for more important purposes - green for denser forestation, yellow for population centers. Instead of hypsometric tinting (darker colors for lower elevations, lighter colors for higher altitudes), Imus uses relief shading for a more natural portrait of U.S. terrain.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0ahttp://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/arts/culturebox/2011/12/indiemaps/111220_CBOX_imusMap.jpg | Don Imus' glorious new map%0a%0ahttp://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/arts/culturebox/2011/12/indiemaps/Cincinnati_2.jpg.CROP.article568-large.jpg | Imus' map on left, `NatGeo map on right, detail of Cincinatti%0a%0ahttp://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/arts/culturebox/2011/12/indiemaps/Chicago.jpg.CROP.article568-large.jpg | Imus' map on left, `NatGeo on right, detail of Chicago%0a%0aPosted: 2012-1-2 22:58%0a%0a

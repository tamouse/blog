I am a personal coach, organizational change guru and technology adoption master. I have worked mostly inside large companies, helping them go through changes to adapt to the new internet economy, including adopting new practices and technologies to work faster with high quality, reducing time to market and infrastructure costs. %0a%0aThrough the use of assessment, facilitation, coaching and communicating, I blend a special mix of interactions with clients to help them determine what is wanted and needed in their lives and their work. %0a%0aI am also a web designer and developer, familiar with the latest technologies in information architecture and content delivery. I'm expert in the use of both static and dynamic web pages, using technology such as  PHP with database support to create web-based applications for businesses. Lately, I have been experimenting with Ruby on Rails and am liking it a lot.%0a%0aPersonally, I am an animal lover, spending some of my time volunteering at the local animal shelter, helping reunite people with their lost pets. This brings me a lot of satisfaction to see the animals as I tour through the kennels with the anxious people looking for their special friend. While I don't currently have a pet myself, I am lucky enough to have friends with animals so I get to be their "aunt".%0a%0aI am a parent of 2 gorgeous girls who are in their twenties, learning what life is all about and doing it with grace and style.%0a%0aI'm also a photographer focusing mostly on botanicals and landscapes. I have recently acquired a high-end digital camera that I am learning how to use. Being in total control of the image from the beginning composition and arrangement to final printing and framing is a highly satisfying hobby. I am working on building a web site that will display some of my favorite images so I can share them with the world. You can view some of my pictures at [[my Flickr pool -> http://flickr.com/photos/tamouse/]] and [[my mobileme photo gallery -> http://gallery.tamaratemple.com]].%0a%0aI have been taking watercolour classes for the past couple of years, and am truly enjoying it.

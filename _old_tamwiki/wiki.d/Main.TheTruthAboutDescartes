So I can't tell you how much pleasure it gives me to put the%0arecord straight, if only for poor Rene's sake.%0a%0aYou may well wonder how it was that Rene managed to reach Number%0aOne among philosophy's all-time chart-toppers.  Well, as I've indicated,%0ait was all due to the widespread misunderstanding about his line "I%0aThink, Therefore I Am".  And to trace the EXACT origin of that I must%0atake you, by the magic of radio, back to the New Year's Eve party which%0aMadame Descartes threw to celebrate the advent of 1636.%0a%0a!!Here's how it really happened%0a%0aShe'd decided that as it was to be an informal affair what she'd%0aserve would be a "buffet" (a French word meaning "we've got more people%0athan chairs").  As she also intended it to be a late do, with the guests%0anot arriving until around 11 o'clock, she ran up an enormous bunch of%0athat Gallic imitation of bacon-and-egg flan they call "Quiches".%0a%0aHowever, Madame made it clear to Rene that although the quiches%0awould be put out on the sideboard in advance -- "what I DON'T want is%0apeople helping themselves all evening and treading their crumbs into the%0aAubusson.  So I'm relying on you to see to it that nobody starts digging%0ainto them until at least an hour after we've seen the New Year in.  Then%0athey can take plates and eat properly!"%0a%0aIronic, isn't it?  The founder of the Cartesian School relegated%0ato the position of Securicor for bacon-and-egg flans.  As he said to%0aFather Dinet -- I haven't mentioned him, but he was a Jesuit priest%0awho was about Rene's only real mate at that time -- as he said to him,%0a"I can't think this is in any way advancing my career.  Being sat down%0ahere at the sideboard till one o'clock in the morning, no way will there%0abe any philosophising done tomorrow.  I'll be like a limp rag."%0a%0aTo which the good Father rejoined an extremely practical rejoiner.%0a"Then why don't you use this as WORKING time?  Take a pen and write%0awhile you're sitting here, set your mind for lofty thoughts and if any%0aarrive, jot them down ona paper serviette.%0a%0a"Not a bad idea at all," said Descartes.  "Give us a borrow of%0ayour quill."%0a%0aSo it was that for the next hour or so, there by the sideboard%0athe two friends sat and Descartes was able to get off quite a few%0azingers relating to corporeal rationality.  It was while he was putting%0ainto shape an eternal verity on adventitious volition that he glanced%0aup and, to his horror, saw that Father Dinet had absent-mindedly helped%0ahimself to a quiche and was quietly munching it.%0a%0aAbout to open his mouth and exclaim "watch it!" They're not supposed%0ato be eaten yet," he became aware of something else.  There, not two%0ayards away -- well within earshot -- stood his wife!!%0a%0aThere was only one thing to do.  Stealthily, Descartes took another%0aserviette, scribbled out his warning, then equally furtively, pushed%0athe serviette under Father Dinet's nose.%0a%0aSo it was that the whole 300-year-old misunderstanding originated.%0aThat message -- the one which Father Dinet was later to publish to the%0aworld as "I Think Therefore I Am" -- all it referred to was the time-ban%0aon the bacon-and-egg flans.%0a%0aThe truth is, what Descartes actually wrote was I THINK THEY'RE%0aFOR 1 A.M.%0a

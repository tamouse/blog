Peaceful, birds singing, water flowing, very little industrial noise filtering in. This was the place that Jesus came to get away from the crowds. Asked his followers who do the people say I am. Peter gave the answer "you are the Christ, the Messiah"%0a%0aThis is not a modern city, but another archiological site. This is clearly an elemental place, with the spirits of the earth and sky mixing into a magical space. I think that is one of the reasons Jesus picked this place to reveal himself to his disciples, as it was an obviously spiritual place. God is not anathemic to the other spirits of the earth (how could he be, since we are also spirits of the earth). He is more than willing to have them celebrate life love and wholeness of creation with us. Where we have fallen is when we start to worship that specific spirit. It isn't so much that God wants us to be focused on Him for selfish reasons, but that he knows the nature of humans (and probably other spirits) is to lose sight of what is possible when their world view narrows down to a local focus.%0a%0aWhat does Jesus become for me? The question is sort of the answer. He is the question that opens up all the possibilities for true life love. Am I focusing on the lesser spirits around me, or am I focusing towards the possibilities. Sek justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with God. This is the credo that I want to live by, and I think I do live by in many ways, especially the emmancipatory work to move people in work organizations able to do or get what what is truly wanted and needed.%0a%0aWrite the words on your heart - carry it with you always and live it out.%0a%0aHere we reaffirm our baptism, make ourselves over again consistently with those words we have written on our heart and turn back to God once again.%0a%0aas you gave to me, so I will give back. %0a*for bringing LAUMC into my life when I needed it, sotati could have talks with John Dodson about my marriage, and about my personal health. Then for bringing Bill and Suzie into my life to help me heal myself. I fel the healing power working through me, and feel stronger and weaker, simulataneously, stronger before my own internal traps and demons, weaker before the truth outside of those circles, but inside of my true self. %0a*for these most recent gifts, I can and will give back.%0a%0aThe Banais area is gorgeous, the headwaters of the Jordan river. We walked up into a grottos and there wer ruins of the Roman city all arround. Some recent excavations have uncoverrd a market place and plaza. We took a hike down to a falls, that was extremely beautiful. I was once again deeply moved by the beauty around me. I had to stop and take pictures several times. The walk was really wonderful, too. Getting up high, getting down low, seeing both wide field and narrow focus, the rushing water a constant companion.%0a%0aAt one point on the hike, I saw a family of three ferrett-looking things run across the path. I was walking pretty quietly, and they scuttled racross about 10 feet in front of me. They were wedge shaped, moe like a beaver, but not as fat. They were about a foot long and 10 inch tail, furry. Small pointeds ears.%0a%0a!!13:17 Golan heights Stop at overlook.%0aCan see into Syria. Israeli Security listening post on big hill behind us. I decided it would be more politic to refrain from taking a picture. I did wave, however.%0a%0aMany, many conflicting points of view; very deeply held beliefs, and wants. Complicated situation all around. Giving up the Golan Heights leaves israel open to direct attack by Syrias, as in the middle 60s4 shelling of farms, andvillages. Kids sleeping in bomb shlters, etc.%0a%0aThe Druze are a separate religion, a branch off of Islam. They are a minority in the are, only about a million total. They are spread throughout Israel, Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan. They are very close-knit, very family oriented. They are not poor, well-educated; most children go to college. They serve in the military of whatever country the live in. They are usually the elite corps; King of Jordan has them for his personal guard.%0a%0aDriving thru the GH we see many military installations. There were several bunkers, trenches, bombed out buildings. In the midst, people are still farming. Tewrrace farming is the style. They take the rocks out of the field, and then build a fence, which ends up being a retaining wall for the field.%0a%0aThere ar mine fields everywhere. This is so sad, to take up so much good land by sowing it with seeds of death.%0a%0aThe heights themselves are a large plain, not a mountain range. They stretch for many miles around. They would lsoseem to be fertile, if water was more readily available. There is some irrigations, but not much. Probably due to military threat. lots of livestock, mostly cattle. Cattle have been in theare for 1000's of years,, tey are evn mntioned in to Bible.%0a%0aAgain, the countryside is beautiful, moerate olin hills, reminiscient of California, with brown golden grasses, not as many trees (and not live oaks, for sure) and volcanic earth.%0a%0aRoadside shrines to fallen heroes and loved ones; a United Nations (blue helmet)%0a%0aLeaving the Height, back to a view of the Sea of Galilee.%0a%0aWho am I, in the context of this trip, discovering the roots of Judeo-Christian culture and beliefs? Who am I?%0a%0a%0a*looking within, the concepts about Jesus as one part of a triune God are merely intellectual constructions that are there as a framework to hold up the screens on which I view my thoughts. They aren't real, or even true, necessarily. There are many aspects of Judaism that I find very compelling. I'm am becoming more sure that I don't believe in the notion of a three part God. It is too small an idea.%0a%0aEven at that, there is little sense in taking the construction and making it into the real truth as so much of Christian dogma and commentary have done. Again, we're looking at the distinctions of our differences and claiming those as truth, rather than the similarities, the common ground upon which we stand, literally and figuratively. The notion of one God or triune God is a red herring. God doesn't want us to fight over these things. The tings we ned to fiht oer are te injustices inflited by ma on fellow man. Love one another is not empty and meaningleS; without it, life is empty and meaningless. It is one very powerfull context for us to create in ourselves.%0a%0a!!16:48 Sapphoris%0a%0aAnother park, archiological excation. Most fascinating thing we saw was a floor mosaic. Very tiny pieces, almost pixelated photo. Brilliant color still.%0a%0aDiscussion about Jesus's first career as a "carpenter". %0a*we don't really need to know the details about the first careers of second career preachers. It is interesting to know what they did, but the details of where they worked aren't that important. %0a*the notion that Joseph and Jesus were joiners, rather than carpenters, is compelling, for both literal and metaphorical reasons. Literally, because there was hardly any wood in Palestine, but lots of stone; stone would be the building material of choice since it was plentifull. A joiner is someone who can fit things together. Metaphorically, this was jesus's message to the people of his time, the Jewish people and the religious structures he was initially seekibg to reform, and also to us, today. Joinery is an excellent metaphor that we should explore more in depth.%0a%0a!!18.15 Safed (tzfad, sfad, sfat, and so on. The city has about 12 different names)%0a%0aWell, it was pretty dissappointing, actually. The few artist shops were almost baren of people, in fact, I am pretty sure that ours was the only tour group there at the time. We made the most it while we could. Some folks went off to find a coffee shop since they were really hungry. Others wandered the streets, continuing the siteseeing.%0a%0aOne shop-owner came up to me in her car and asked me if I was part off a tour group, and were we leaving soon. She wanted to open her shop so we could all look around. She had some nice things; ltd. ed. of some Chagall lithographs, some nice sculpture, some jewelry, we finally managed to escape from the sales lady / owner and get on the bus home. %0a

Who were the people in the painting? What techniques did Rembrandt pioneer in this particular work? %0a%0aIn a room next to the gallery which held the painting, the curators papered the walls with these questions (and answers). Visitors had to pass through this room before entering the gallery. The curious outcome was that the average length of time people spent viewing the painting increased from six minutes to over half an hour. Visitors alternated between reading questions and answers and examining the painting. They said that the questions encouraged them to look longer, to look closer and to remember more. The questions helped them create richer ideas about the painting and to see the painting in new ways. Like a series of magnets, the questions attracted the visitors' thoughts to fresh ideas.%0a%0aTom Wujec, also the author of [[(Goodreads:)Pumping Ions]], can be reached at mailto:tomwujec@passport.ca %0a

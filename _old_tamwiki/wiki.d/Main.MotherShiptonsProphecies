A satanist? Possessed? Gifted? Used of God? Whatever you say, the evidence certainly suggests Mother Shipton was the closest thing to a prophetess that England had for many generations. Of her lfe we know some, not much. Mother Shipton, sometimes called "the Yorkshire Sybil" was reputedly born Ursula Sontheil (or Southill) in 1488 in Norfolk, England (supposedly in the cave of Knaresborough), and died in 1561. Her mother Agatha was well known for her exceptional powers. Ursula, too, exhibited prophetic and psychic abilities from an early age. At 24, married to one Toby Shipton, she eventually became known as Mother Shipton. Many of her visions came true within her own lifetime and in subsequent centuries. I first learned of her through an old time holy roller preacher, Bishop Whitlock, in Lewiston, California. But with all the Y2K hoopla, her fame seems enigmatically to be spreading. These rare verses from Mother Shipton seem to have prophetic indications for our times, and while open to interpretation, they show this woman to have been uncannily prescient. %0a%0a"This was given to Laurent under the Tree in Athens, Georgia by Tim Mills in October, 1944.

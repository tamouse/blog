If you want to make a change to a business process, the best way is to harness peoples' creativity and enthusiasm. This is true even if you call it problem solving rather than bpr. If you want change to be significant, you have to get people to thnk beyond their day-to-day routines. Despite all our modern enlightened management, there are still plenty of people who see their role as to fulfil a very tightly specified function and never to really think about it. If you want them to really think, you need a vision of how the process could be in a perfect world if all things were possible. This is what I see as the End-state, although it is only really the end of the current step, not the end forever. %0a%0aAre we ignoring the current state? Well you would be if you decided to design a process (system) based on your vision only. But that seems unwise. For example, I know a bit about Production Management (I teach it, and you learn a lot that way) but I couldn't specify in detail a Production mgt / order flow process for a company without knowing the strategic aims (cost/ time reduction, volume, design etc). I would want to know how the manufacturing process worked and how it varied. I would want to know what kind of unusual things happen with customers and suppliers and materials and machines and employees. And even with that kind of information I would still feel happier involving the people who are going to operate the new process. This is because to design a system you have to understand the environment in which it operates. That understanding is accrued over time by the people concerned, and in the routines they develop to deal with anomalies. Now, many of those routines represent the waste we want to remove, but some represent important operating issues which we must not overlook in the new design. I would suggest that knowledge is hidden in those people and in their ways of working. Involving people in the design process is not just about being nice to them and helping them to design meaningful whole jobs and working relationships, it is also about tapping the company's main asset, its experience. %0a%0aModelling is usually proposed as the way to understand the existing state. A good set of flowcharts, IDEFo charts or RADs or whatever-you-like appears to show in great detail how business is done. Modelling can be a great experience, because sometimes managers realise what happens in their departments. But you can't use models to show the experience hidden in peoples' heads. A challenge: In your current bpr project, take a look at your charts. for customer order flow or for the flow of patients through your hospital. Now go and follow a customer order through the factory or a patient through the hospital. It isn't like you thought it was. Because in the kind of business you want to re-engineer, there isn't a single unique way of doing things. Every case is a special case. The charts give a general idea of the general kind of flow, but they never get into all the possibilities. And it is all the possibilities, the workarounds, the exceptions, which cause you to need to redesign in the first place. And they are the things which teach you about your products, your customers, your world. Important. So modelling can only be a guide to how bad things are, and a tool for drawing your new ideas. It doesn't help you to design new processes. That's why it doesn't much matter which tool you use. %0a%0aAnother caution on modelling. The more you model, the more you will understand the existing process. The more you understand it, the more you will see the need for it to be the way it is. The more you need it to be as it is, the more you lose sight of your Vision. You get sucked down into the mire. If this happens, you'll be lucky to get an incremental change. So it's important to do the visioning thing before the modelling, or at least to do it separately. %0a%0aTo me, bpr is about two things. 1. Understanding that business is a process, and looking at the performance of the whole, so that you don't improve things that shouldn't be there. 2. Managing the change. This means getting people moving, being creative, visionary and participative. It means tapping peoples' experience, and not losing it. %0a%0aThe first one is easy. %0a%0aAnd another thing, while I'm about it. Re-engineering is about continuous improvement. Once you do the big step, you do some small steps. If you get good at taking small steps, you don't need the big ones so much (Kaizen). As someone commented recently, it's about painting the Forth Bridge. (or some less famous river crossing) You never finish. So I think it is really quite important to be careful about getting rid of the bits you don't need. We are in a changing world, blah blah blah and you don't know what business you will be in next year. The capabilities the organisation currently possesses may not all look useful at the moment, but one may be the bit that gives you the ability to reconfigure later. Don't get too lean. We throw away the old jigs and fixtures that we don't need. If ever we did need them again, we could have them re-made. But not if we also threw away the drawings and let go the engineer with the knowledge. %0a%0aHope this helps %0a%0aMerry Christmas everyone %0a%0aDr Steve Childe University of Plymouth, UK %0a%0a----%0a%0a&gt;My contention is that the individuals view of the world determines the \\%0a&gt;starting point. %0a%0aWhat we try to do is accomodate individuals preferred type/temperament while keeping them in the future state. The future need not be taken as a whole to start with; we try to get them to be as specific as possible about what they are doing, feeling, sensing, or thinking while they are in the future state. We attempt to elicit from them as complete a picture of the future state as possible, using their particular MB preferred modes to do so. %0a%0a&gt;If as a BPR practitioner I have a "sensate view" of the world then I \\%0a&gt;acquire detail and build my big picture from there. In other words i \\%0a&gt;start with the now. %0a%0aIn this case, we look at the very specific things the sensor will perceive in the future state: "what does it look, feel, sound, taste like?" and build up the picture of the future state from their sensory perceptions about it. %0a%0a&gt;If as a BPR practitioner I have an "intuitive view" of the world then I \\%0a&gt;want to start with the big picture and then fill in appropriate detail. \\%0a&gt;I start with the where to and the present then becomes one of the details \\%0a&gt;I may need to look at later. %0a%0aAdmittedly, it is easier for us to elicit the future state from the intuitor, but only when they are in the future state as well. It is just as easy for intuitors to have the big picture in the current state and, unfortunately, be stuck there. It is also sometimes difficult to get the intuitor to be specific about their views. We start with the big picture and chunk down to get at specifics, while trying to ensure that what is wanted is as well-formed as possible (clearly possible, self-directed, a good sense of the benefit and how they would know if they got it). %0a%0aEliciting the future state provides people, in whatever style, with a more resourceful playground. With the current state, people are less resourceful, and we've found it difficult to reach agreement and alignment, and have generally found that things don't progress from there. %0a%0aWhen communicating the future state back to an organization, we have to address all types and temperaments, so that the sensors are able to grasp it, the intuitors get it, the feelers feel it and the thinkers know it. %0a%0a&gt;To change \\%0a&gt;ones mind and start with the now would, under my notion, need a change of \\%0a&gt;view of the world not just a change in starting point. %0a%0aI hope I've offered a glimpse of an alternative. The elicitation process must take into account the type/temperament, that I certainly agree with. The starting point is typically whereever they are at that point in time. Frequently, when we start working with people, they are deeply mired in the current state. This is clear from how they describe "the future": usually it is things they '''don't''' want. We move them to the future state by accepting the things they don't want, and then asking them what they '''do''' want, and then work to get that as well-formed and -specified as possible. %0a%0aWe '''do''' want to change people's minds in some ways: we want to make sure they become excited about the future state and feel / think they can achieve it. %0a%0aBest, \\%0aTamara Temple%0a%0a-----%0a%0aTam. G'day %0a%0aAre you taking the approach you described in your message. %0a%0aMy interpretation of what you said is that by determing peoples preferences you can capitailize on them. Also by being aware of their "weaknesses" you therefore have an idea of the areas you may have to put more emphasis on. %0a%0aIs [Company XYZ] doing this now ? %0a%0aRegards Denis %0a%0a----%0a%0a&gt;My interpretation of what you said is that by determing peoples \\%0a&gt;preferences you can capitailize on them. %0a%0aSort of. We don't run around doing MB inventories of everyone we work with. It's more a matter of trying to fit what we do to many different styles. The type/temperament preference is something we try to accomodate to so we can hit on everybody's channels, not just a few. I also work at exposing these different preferences so that the team itself can learn to accomodate to the individual's channels. This is only part of getting the team to capitalize on each other's talents. Certainly expertise, experience, operating style, and other things are grist for the team mill. %0a%0a&gt;Also by being aware of \\%0a&gt;their "weaknesses" you therefore have an idea of the areas you may have to \\%0a&gt;put more emphasis on. %0a%0aNot exactly what I had in mind. The various preferences for type/temperament don't naturally lend themselves to weaknesses in an organization. The only time I've actually made an intervention along these lines is where a team had been picked that was all the same temperament. I strongly suggested to the sponsor that they constitute a more diverse group, and she did. %0a%0aIt is an interesting concept, though, that there might be specific areas to concentrate on improving as an organization based on the MB spread. In my experience, I've found that there are several things an organization can work on around communications, which is most certainly tied to MB t/t (there is even a tool developed by Paul Mok (PhD, I think) called "A Survey of Communication Styles" which uses the central four types of the MB space to categorize how people prefer to communicate. It's quite a bit shorter that even the self-scoring MBI. (Contact Training Associates Press in the US at 214-437-3535 for more info.) We've used the survey in training courses for teaching change agents. It's more to illustrate that there are different styles (amazing how that eludes some people). %0a%0a&gt;Is [Company XYZ] doing this now ? %0a%0aTo say that "XYZ" is doing anything is likely to be both true and false; we're rather large, so somewhere, someone is doing something. WRT using MB, I'd have to say that '''I''' (and some others in my group) try to make note of the types/temperaments that are presenting and work to accomodate them. We are pretty small, about 40 people, working mostly in software-related or -supported businesses within XYZ, which is about 95,000 people! We do a fair amount of process-related work as well as some basic software engineering capability building. %0a%0aEmail seems so low-bandwidth for this sort of communcation. I'm sure I've left out a lot of important background detail. %0a%0aCheers, \\%0aTamara%0a

Five Rules for Conducting Rancor-Free Political Conversations%0a%0a[[http://blogs.forbes.com/shenegotiates/ | Victoria Pynchon]], Contributor%0a%0aBecause I’ll be talking about solutions for Minnesota’s budget stalemate on [[http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/programs/midmorning/index.php?date=05-23-2011 | MPR’s Mid-Morning with Kerri Miller]] this coming Monday, I’ve been thinking about ways politicians and their constituents – that’s us! – can have rancor-free political conversations.%0a%0aBased on my education and training as a mediator, as well as nearly six years of full-time mediation practice, I’m setting forth five simple rules that can make those conversations productive rather than destructive.%0a%0a!! 1. First, Agree Upon Rules for Civil Discourse%0a%0aCiting former [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Nye | Virginia Congressman Glenn Nye]], the Director of [[http://www.peninsulamediation.com/ | Peninsula Mediation &amp; ADR]] [[http://www.mediate.com/people/personprofile.cfm?auid=974 | Merri L. Hanson]] recently [[//www.mediate.com/articles/hansonM3.cfm | observed]] that civil discourse requires political leaders to take the emotion of their constituents and distill it down to good policy by:%0a%0a>>quote%3c%3c%0aDemonstrating that they understand what people feel and how strongly they feel it;%0a%0aArticulating what the various sides share (identifying and building on shared interests); and,%0a%0aAgreeing to focus on engaged decision making through robust discussion of merits.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aThe [[http://www.publicconversations.org | Public Conversations Project]] suggests that people who wish to constructively discuss divisive political issues should agree on the following conversational parameters:%0a%0a>>quote%3c%3c%0athe parties will share speaking and listening time, not interrupting each other and limiting themselves to a preset amount of time (e.g., 4 minutes);%0a%0aspeak for themselves from personal experience, not trying to represent or defend an entire political party or ideological approach (tell a story rather than assert an opinion or position); and,%0a%0amaintain the spirit of dialogue by avoiding a critical or dismissive tone, aiming simply to understand rather than to persuade.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aThe Project’s excellent publication ''[[http://www.publicconversations.org/docs/resources/red_blue.pdf | Reaching Out Across the Red-Blue Divide]]'' provides a step-by-step guide for conducting a civil dialogue – a guide every elected representative and candidate for office should read, take to heart, and put into practice especially any time he or she recognizes that special interests ([[http://finapps.forbes.com/finapps/jsp/finance/compinfo/CIAtAGlance.jsp?tkr=XOM | petrochemicals]] or [[http://finapps.forbes.com/finapps/jsp/finance/compinfo/CIAtAGlance.jsp?tkr=PFE | pharmaceuticals]], for instance) rather than the welfare of the people, may be driving his or her conversation.%0a%0a!! 2. If a Dispute Arises, Determine Whether It’s Based on the Parties’ Use of Different Data or Different Interpretations of the Same Data%0a%0aAs the [[http://www.internetmediator.com/ | Oregon Mediation Center’s]] Conflict Resolution [[http://www.internetmediator.com/medres/pg18.cfm | Training Manual]] explains,%0a%0a>>quote%3c%3c%0a&ldquo;Data conflicts occur when people lack information necessary to make wise decisions, are misinformed, disagree on which data is relevant, interpret information differently, or have competing assessment procedures. Some data conflicts may be unnecessary since they are caused by poor communication between the people in conflict. Other data conflicts may be genuine incompatibilities associated with data collection, interpretation or communication. '''Most data conflicts will have &lsquo;data solutions.&rsquo;&rdquo;'''%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aIf you think hard enough, I’ll wager you can pin-point on-going disputes with family or friends that are based on "data conflicts."%0a%0aI re-visited one of my own last night while explaining the public employment aspect of the Minnesota budget debate to my husband. I referenced the "data conflict" among Minnesota voters – that the "slash spending" crowd included the cost of benefits when comparing public and private employee salaries while the "tax the rich" crowd did not.%0a%0aIt made a huge difference, I said, in voters' attitudes about benefits for public employees since the rest of us do not tend to "count" the cost of benefits when thinking about how much money we make. My husband then launched into a peroration about the unfairness of public pensions.%0a%0a&ldquo;Public employees give up more money today in exchange for security tomorrow,&rdquo; I argued, &ldquo;and private employees make the choice of earning more money today and deciding for themselves whether they’ll invest some of that money for retirement in the future.&rdquo;%0a%0aI’ve been saying this and my husband has been contesting it for the past ten years. No kidding. Ten ''years.''%0a%0a&ldquo;You keep saying that but you don’t know that’s true,&rdquo; my husband responded, as he ''always'' does.%0a%0aI’d never thought the argument important enough to do a little research and frankly had never seen it sourced in a &ldquo;data conflict&rdquo; before last night. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; I said, after a wearying half-hour of familiar arguments, &ldquo;this dispute ''has'' sapped our energies enough to justify research.&rdquo;%0a%0aI’d love to tell you that I thereafter found the answer – and one that proved me right – but I didn’t. For the tiny political husband-wife divide in my house, however, I’ve surrendered, letting my political "opponent" know that my research showed he might just be ''right ''and I could well be ''wrong''.%0a%0aIf you’re interested in this issue, two of the articles I found attempting to make an apples-to-apples comparison between private and public employee compensation are [[http://educationnext.org/comparable-worth/ | here]] and [[http://www.mnchamber.com/compstudy.highlights.final.12.9.10.pdf | here]].%0a%0a!! 3. The Parties Should Acknowledge that Neither "Side" Can "Win" the Debate and Commit Themselves to Finding a Cooperative Solution%0a%0a[[http:/umn.edu | University of Minnesota]] Professors [[http://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/people/Faculty/Johnson.html | David W. Johnson]] and [[http://www.cehd.umn.edu/CI/Faculty/Johnson.html | Roger T. Johnson]] [[http://www.co-operation.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Peace-Ed-Salomon-09.pdf | suggest ]]that cooperation among parties with diverse interests can best be achieved%0a%0a>>quote%3c%3c%0ain an atmosphere of positive interdependence where individuals believe they are so linked with others that they cannot succeed unless the others do;%0a%0aamong participants engaged in activities with mutual goals, joint rewards, complementary roles, and a shared identity;%0a%0awhen each collaborator is individually accountable for their fair share of the work and is given the opportunity to promote one another’s success by helping, assisting, supporting, encouraging, and praising all efforts to achieve the group goals;%0a%0aif the participants have strong interpersonal and small group skills, such as leadership, decision making, trust building, communication, and conflict management skills; and,%0a%0awhere group members are allowed to discuss how well they are achieving their goals and maintaining effective working relationships.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aThese aspirational characteristics of cooperative groups aside, my own personal experience is that the moment everyone realizes no one can drill a hole in the other side of the boat without sinking themselves, cooperation always begins.%0a%0a!! 4. Use Interest-Based Rather than Competitive Negotiation Strategies and Tactics to Solve the Mutual Problem of Conflicting Political Views%0a%0aThe two Professors Johnson preach what we here at ''[[http://www.shenegotiates.com/retreats/ | She Negotiates]]'' [[http://www.shenegotiates.com/retreats/ | teach]], that collaborative, interest-based negotiation leads to better negotiated outcomes for all parties. The step-by-step procedure recommended by these two U. of Minn professors are:%0a%0a>>quote%3c%3c%0a%0a# The participants should start by describing the result they want that they believe would flow from their political position;%0a%0a# They should also describe how they feel about the conflict;%0a%0a# They should detail the reasons underlying their needs and desires;%0a%0a# Everyone should agree that the group intention is to be cooperative, listen carefully, separate the people from the problem (no ''ad hominem'' attacks); differentiate their interests before attempting to integrate them; and, take the other's perspective; and,%0a%0a# Invent several optional plans to resolve the conflict that maximize joint benefits.%0a%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a!! 5. Avoid the Following Deadly Conversational Traps%0a%0aWhen we’re frustrated with reasoned dialogue, we all too often destroy the progress we’ve made by falling into any of the following behaviors%0a%0a>>quote%3c%3c%0a%0amaking statements that lock us into extreme positions we can’t back out of;%0a%0afrequently interrupting our conversational partners, exploding in angry outbursts, or engaging in personal attacks;%0a%0aselectively attending to and reasserting facts that support our views while scanning the assertions of others for evidence of falsehood, ill intent, and ignorance;%0a%0ausing slogans, shorthand, and buzz words that simplify the issues and mean different things to different people; and,%0a%0aasking few genuine questions and making assumptions about the meanings, intentions, and values of opponents without investigation.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0aAs the Public Conversations Project [[http://www.publicconversations.org/docs/resources/Jams_website.pdf | suggests]], we can tell we’ve fallen into these common destructive communication patterns if little new information surfaces; the conversation becomes repetitive; and, the discussion feels old.%0a%0aEngaging in constructive dialogue about difficult issues is not easy for anyone. The best of us will fail repeatedly in our efforts to learn how and why our presumed adversaries believe the facts they do and have the opinions they hold. In this regard, patience is a virtue, forgiveness a curative and the desire for a more peaceful world a goal worth striving for.%0a%0a%0a(:linkwikiwords:)%0a%0a>>comment%3c%3c%0aSummary: The best of us will fail repeatedly in our efforts to learn how and why our presumed adversaries believe the facts they do and have the opinions they hold.

The step-by-step procedure recommended by these two U. of Minn professors are:%0a%3c %0a%3c >>quote%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c # The participants should start by describing the result they want that they believe would flow from their political position;%0a%3c %0a%3c # They should also describe how they feel about the conflict;%0a%3c %0a%3c # They should detail the reasons underlying their needs and desires;%0a%3c %0a%3c # Everyone should agree that the group intention is to be cooperative, listen carefully, separate the people from the problem (no ''ad hominem'' attacks); differentiate their interests before attempting to integrate them; and, take the other's perspective; and,%0a%3c %0a%3c # Invent several optional plans to resolve the conflict that maximize joint benefits.%0a%3c %0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c !! 5. Avoid the Following Deadly Conversational Traps%0a%3c %0a%3c When we’re frustrated with reasoned dialogue, we all too often destroy the progress we’ve made by falling into any of the following behaviors%0a%3c %0a%3c >>quote%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c making statements that lock us into extreme positions we can’t back out of;%0a%3c %0a%3c frequently interrupting our conversational partners, exploding in angry outbursts, or engaging in personal attacks;%0a%3c %0a%3c selectively attending to and reasserting facts that support our views while scanning the assertions of others for evidence of falsehood, ill intent, and ignorance;%0a%3c %0a%3c using slogans, shorthand, and buzz words that simplify the issues and mean different things to different people; and,%0a%3c %0a%3c asking few genuine questions and making assumptions about the meanings, intentions, and values of opponents without investigation.%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c As the Public Conversations Project [[http://www.publicconversations.org/docs/resources/Jams_website.pdf | suggests]], we can tell we’ve fallen into these common destructive communication patterns if little new information surfaces; the conversation becomes repetitive; and, the discussion feels old.%0a%3c %0a%3c Engaging in constructive dialogue about difficult issues is not easy for anyone. The best of us will fail repeatedly in our efforts to learn how and why our presumed adversaries believe the facts they do and have the opinions they hold. In this regard, patience is a virtue, forgiveness a curative and the desire for a more peaceful world a goal worth striving for.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a---%0a>  Page  1 [[/sites/shenegotiates/2011/05/21/five-rules-for-conducting-rancor-free-political-conversations/2/ | 2]]  [[#prev | « Previous Page]] [[/sites/shenegotiates/2011/05/21/five-rules-for-conducting-rancor-free-political-conversations/2/ |  Next Page » ]][[#comments_header |  0 comments, 0 called-out ]][[#comment_reply |  + Comment now ]][[#comment_reply | + Comment now]]%0a> %0a> *%0a> *%0a> *%0a> *%0a> *%0a> *%0a> %0a> [[/sites/shenegotiates/2011/05/21/five-rules-for-conducting-rancor-free-political-conversations/print/ | Print]][[#corrections | Report Corrections]][[http://forbesreprints.magreprints.com/ | Reprints &amp; Permissions]]%0a> %0a> !!!

First, Agree Upon Rules for Civil Discourse'''%0a%3c %0a%3c Citing former [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Nye | Virginia Congressman Glenn Nye]], the Director of [[http://www.peninsulamediation.com/ | Peninsula Mediation &amp; ADR]] [[http://www.mediate.com/people/personprofile.cfm?auid=974 | Merri L. Hanson]] recently [[//www.mediate.com/articles/hansonM3.cfm | observed]] that civil discourse requires political leaders to take the emotion of their constituents and distill it down to good policy by:%0a%3c %0a%3c ->Demonstrating that they understand what people feel and how strongly they feel it;Articulating what the various sides share (identifying and building on shared interests); and,Agreeing to focus on engaged decision making through robust discussion of merits.%0a%3c %0a%3c The [[http://www.publicconversations.org | Public Conversations Project]] suggests that people who wish to constructively discuss divisive political issues should agree on the following conversational parameters:%0a%3c %0a%3c ->the parties will share speaking and listening time, not interrupting each other and limiting themselves to a preset amount of time (e.g., 4 minutes);speak for themselves from personal experience, not trying to represent or defend an entire political party or ideological approach (tell a story rather than assert an opinion or position); and,maintain the spirit of dialogue by avoiding a critical or dismissive tone, aiming simply to understand rather than to persuade.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Project’s excellent publication ''[[http://www.publicconversations.org/docs/resources/red_blue.pdf | Reaching Out Across the Red-Blue Divide]]'' provides a step-by-step guide for conducting a civil dialogue – a guide every elected representative and candidate for office should read, take to heart, and put into practice especially any time he or she recognizes that special interests ([[http://finapps.forbes.com/finapps/jsp/finance/compinfo/CIAtAGlance.jsp?tkr=XOM | petrochemicals]] or [[http://finapps.forbes.com/finapps/jsp/finance/compinfo/CIAtAGlance.jsp?tkr=PFE | pharmaceuticals]], for instance) rather than the welfare of the people, may be driving his or her conversation.%0a%3c %0a%3c '''2. If a Dispute Arises, Determine Whether It’s Based on the Parties’ Use of Different Data or Different Interpretations of the Same Data'''%0a%3c %0a%3c As the [[http://www.internetmediator.com/ | Oregon Mediation Center’s]] Conflict Resolution [[http://www.internetmediator.com/medres/pg18.cfm | Training Manual]] explains,%0a%3c %0a%3c ->''Data conflicts occur when people lack information necessary to make wise decisions, are misinformed, disagree on which data is relevant, interpret information differently, or have competing assessment procedures. Some data conflicts may be unnecessary since they are caused by poor communication between the people in conflict. Other data conflicts may be genuine incompatibilities associated with data collection, interpretation or communication. ''''Most data conflicts will have “data solutions.”''%0a%3c %0a%3c If you think hard enough, I’ll wager you can pin-point on-going disputes with family or friends that are based on “data conflicts.”%0a%3c %0a%3c I re-visited one of my own last night while explaining the public employment aspect of the Minnesota budget debate to my husband. I referenced the “data conflict” among Minnesota voters – that the “slash spending” crowd included the cost of benefits when comparing public and private employee salaries while the “tax the rich” crowd did not.%0a%3c %0a%3c It made a huge difference, I said, in voters’ attitudes about benefits for public employees since the rest of us do not tend to “count” the cost of benefits when thinking about how much money we make. My husband then launched into a peroration about the unfairness of public pensions.%0a%3c %0a%3c “Public employees give up more money today in exchange for security tomorrow,” I argued, “and private employees make the choice of earning more money today and deciding for themselves whether they’ll invest some of that money for retirement in the future.”%0a%3c %0a%3c I’ve been saying this and my husband has been contesting it for the past ten years. No kidding. Ten ''years.''%0a%3c %0a%3c  Page  1 [[/sites/shenegotiates/2011/05/21/five-rules-for-conducting-rancor-free-political-conversations/2/ | 2]]  [[#prev | « Previous Page]] [[/sites/shenegotiates/2011/05/21/five-rules-for-conducting-rancor-free-political-conversations/2/ |  Next Page » ]][[#comments_header |  0 comments, 0 called-out ]][[#comment_reply |  + Comment now ]][[#comment_reply | + Comment now]]%0a%3c %0a%3c *%0a%3c *%0a%3c *%0a%3c *%0a%3c *%0a%3c *%0a%3c %0a%3c [[/sites/shenegotiates/2011/05/21/five-rules-for-conducting-rancor-free-political-conversations/print/ | Print]][[#corrections | Report Corrections]][[http://forbesreprints.magreprints.com/ | Reprints &amp; Permissions]]%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!

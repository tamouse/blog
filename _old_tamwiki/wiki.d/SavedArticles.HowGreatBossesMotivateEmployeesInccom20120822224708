Remember where you came from, and be gracious with your stardom.%0a %0aRemarkable bosses aren’t great on paper. Great bosses are remarkable based on their actions.%0a%0aResults are everything—but not the results you might think.%0a%0aConsistently do these five things and everything else follows. You and your business benefit greatly.%0a%0aMore importantly, so do your employees.%0a%0a1. Develop every employee. Sure, you can put your primary focus on reaching targets, achieving results, and accomplishing concrete goals—but do that and you put your leadership cart before your achievement horse.%0a%0aWithout great employees, no amount of focus on goals and targets will ever pay off. Employees can only achieve what they are capable of achieving, so it’s your job to help all your employees be more capable so they—and your business—can achieve more.%0a%0aIt's your job to provide the training, mentoring, and opportunities your employees need and deserve. When you do, you transform the relatively boring process of reviewing results and tracking performance into something a lot more meaningful for your employees: Progress, improvement, and personal achievement.%0a%0aSo don’t worry about reaching performance goals. Spend the bulk of your time developing the skills of your employees and achieving goals will be a natural outcome.%0a%0aPlus it’s a lot more fun.%0a%0a2. Deal with problems immediately. Nothing kills team morale more quickly than problems that don't get addressed. Interpersonal squabbles, performance issues, feuds between departments... all negatively impact employee motivation and enthusiasm.%0a%0aAnd they're distracting, because small problems never go away. Small problems always fester and grow into bigger problems. Plus, when you ignore a problem your employees immediately lose respect for you, and without respect, you can't lead.%0a%0aNever hope a problem will magically go away, or that someone else will deal with it. Deal with every issue head-on, no matter how small.%0a%0a3. Rescue your worst employee. Almost every business has at least one employee who has fallen out of grace: Publicly failed to complete a task, lost his cool in a meeting, or just can’t seem to keep up. Over time that employee comes to be seen by his peers—and by you—as a weak link.%0a%0aWhile that employee may desperately want to “rehabilitate” himself, it's almost impossible. The weight of team disapproval is too heavy for one person to move.%0a%0aBut it’s not too heavy for you.%0a%0aBefore you remove your weak link from the chain, put your full effort into trying to rescue that person instead. Say, "John, I know you've been struggling but I also know you're trying. Let's find ways together that can get you where you need to be." Express confidence. Be reassuring. Most of all, tell him you'll be there every step of the way.%0a%0aDon't relax your standards. Just step up the mentoring and coaching you provide.%0a%0aIf that seems like too much work for too little potential outcome, think of it this way. Your remarkable employees don’t need a lot of your time; they’re remarkable because they already have these qualities. If you’re lucky, you can get a few percentage points of extra performance from them. But a struggling employee has tons of upside; rescue him and you make a tremendous difference.%0a%0aGranted, sometimes it won't work out. When it doesn't, don't worry about it.  The effort is its own reward.%0a%0aAnd occasionally an employee will succeed—and you will have made a tremendous difference in a person's professional and personal life.%0a%0aCan’t beat that.%0a%0a4. Serve others, not yourself. You can get away with being selfish or self-serving once or twice... but that's it.%0a%0aNever say or do anything that in any way puts you in the spotlight, however briefly. Never congratulate employees and digress for a few moments to discuss what you did.%0a%0aIf it should go without saying, don't say it. Your glory should always be reflected, never direct.%0aRecommended Videos%0aLeader in Motion: How Choreographer Bill T. Jones Collaborates%0aHow a Disaster on Everest Inspired an Entrepreneur%0aMeet the Husband-Wife Team Behind Babysitter Site Sittercity%0a%0aWhen employees excel, you and your business excel. When your team succeeds, you and your business succeed. When you rescue a struggling employee and they become remarkable, remember they should be congratulated, not you.%0a%0aYou were just doing your job the way a remarkable boss should.%0a%0aWhen you consistently act as if you are less important than your employees—and when you never ask employees to do something you don’t do—everyone knows how important you really are.%0a%0a5. Always remember where you came from. See an autograph seeker blown off by a famous athlete and you might think, “If I was in a similar position I would never do that.”%0a%0aOops. Actually, you do. To some of your employees, especially new employees, you are at least slightly famous. You’re in charge. You’re the boss.%0a%0aThat's why an employee who wants to talk about something that seems inconsequential may just want to spend a few moments with you.%0a%0aWhen that happens, you have a choice. You can blow the employee off... or you can see the moment for its true importance: A chance to inspire, reassure, motivate, and even give someone hope for greater things in their life. The higher you rise the greater the impact you can make—and the greater your responsibility to make that impact.%0a%0aIn the eyes of his or her employees, a remarkable boss is a star.%0a%0aRemember where you came from, and be gracious with your stardom.%0a%0aJeff Haden learned much of what he knows about business and technology as he worked his way up in the manufacturing industry. Everything else he picks up from ghostwriting books for some of the smartest leaders he knows in business. @jeff_haden%0a%0a(:linkwikiwords:)%0a

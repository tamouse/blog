Responses were varied ... from exercise such	as walking or jogging ... to taking a nap ... to "strong	psychedelics." Strong emotions such as being sad or depressed vied	with distracting activities such as taking a shower or driving as the	leading stimuli. Quite a few of you found mowing the lawn a creative	turn-on.%0a%0aThanks to all of you who responded ... here's a summary:%0a%0aFrom Bill Wohler -- Brain-storming sessions with brilliant people. Attending a conference.%0a%0aFrom Hilary Jackson -- Spending time with people who make me feel good, being involved in an activity I love. Then again, sometimes the best poetry I write is when I am feeling sad/melancholic, so perhaps its more the feeling of strong emotion that gets my creative juices flowing.%0a%0aFrom Robert Alan Black -- As a speaker it is the responses: verbally, physically, visually and emotionally I receive from the audience.%0a%0aFrom J. Heller -- Getting lots of rest, and experiencing beautiful, moving, or otherwise stimulating parts of the world that are totally different from the kind of work I'm doing - like viewing good art work, reading an entertaining piece of fiction, seeing natural beauty, or going to a good movie.%0a%0aFrom Sharon L. Casteel -- A trip to a new place tends to do it for me -- I always come back with my mind popping with ideas.%0a%0aFrom Ron Richards -- When I have a triumph it gives me a sense of ease and power that opens my mind to ambitious new directions and breakthroughs. In creativity, the rich get richer? Should I use those times to have a 1-2 day retreat to use my mindset to the hilt?%0a%0aFrom Lois Clark McCoy -- My answer may seem too obvious. But my most productive ideas come after I take TIME-OUT to THINK! These days it's hard to block out a time to let your mind run.  I find it's easy to do my creative thinking on long drives.  I've put 12,000 miles on my car these last 2 1/2 months (driving alone) and it has giving me so many great projects and ideas that I'm driving my staff wild!%0a%0aFrom Philippe Scheimann -- Putting an anchor (connected to creativity) on the start-up item of my powerbook.%0a%0aFrom vantonia -- a/ A strong cause, a strong motivation to solve a problem.  b/ A good-friends gathering, where an atmosphere of freedom, playfulness, sense of humour and most importantly craziness is present, and where restrictions, formality & uptightness are absent.  c/ Deep meditation%0a%0a%0aFrom Les Jones -- Visiting a highly-loaded environment (bookstore, epicurean supply house, antique store, junk yard, etc.) with a question/problem to be solved in mind combined with a jolt of coffee and/or brisk exercise: roller skating to the bookstore after I've had coffee for example.%0a%0aFrom D'n Russler -- 48 straight wake-time. By that time I've deadened out all the cliches and standard approches, and begin to think on over- drive. If I don't collapse first.%0a%0aFrom Gary M. Oppenheimer -- My best creative thinking occurs when OTHER people have problems - Unfortunately, I can solve others problems much better than my own %3cg>%0a%0aFrom Patricia Roscoe -- Scuba diving - I '''used''' to think it was just due to the increased oxygen and perhaps the strenuous exercise having the beneficial effect. I now think that having the experience of partial isolation (from verbal interactions with others) in '''another''' world, accounts for most of it. When scuba diving, I find myself focusing intensely on my immediate surroundings, requiring that I actively attend to ever detail of the "now" experience. This trains the brain to focus in other situations too (or maybe it is the oxygen!)%0a%0aFrom Joe Esh -- I ponder. After I ponder I "get" my most creative ideas/actions. But pondering, real genuine pondering is almost an art, and a cousin to openness. It is not worrying about a problem, but standing back and looking at my life. Then, at times, I see a way I hadn't noticed before then. And when that happens . . . creativity.%0a%0aFrom Chuck Roberts -- 75%25 of my most creative moments come just as i'm drifting off to sleep. I'm usually in a state of being half asleep, so I have to get myself awake to write down my ideas.%0a%0aFrom Larry Fjeldstrom -- I need at least 16 hours of GOOD sleep in the 48 hours preceeding my best creative output. It also helps if I exchange a few jokes with at least 10 people during the same 48 hours (during my waking hours that is!) I find humour (especially puns) very good for stirring up stagnant grey-matter!%0a%0aFrom Renae Raz -- I do my best creative work after a vigorous walk in the cool air. When the leaves are falling is the best time to walk and think/clear my head, then when I get back to my desk, the ideas and thoughts seem to come to me a bit easier.%0a%0aFrom Philip Mason -- First, I identify the creative task I hope to accomplish, and briefly think it through. Then I let it go, and focus on other things for a week or so (if I have the luxury of that kind of time). I find that when I'm ready to begin the task, my subconscious has already worked out most of the details and I my creativity comes forth easily. Newspaper people use the term "writing off the wall" for this technique, meaning that they can almost read the completed story off the wall as they write it.%0a%0aFrom Thomas Short -- Reading about some political or financial outrage in the paper - spurs me on to write some impassioned rant and fire it off to the editor via fax (my mental image of this is like firing a high powered rifle shot at a far off target with pinpoint accuracy). The words flow, and often need no revision when my passion has been hit - usually stupidity, waste, social injustice, govermental excess, etc.%0a%0aFrom Marian Thier -- After I spend time with stimulating clients; i.e. clients with interesting challenges for me and them.%0a%0aFrom Richard Clingman -- We have a spa outdoors on our deck. I find that when it is cold out (preferably below 40 degrees F) and I get in that 100+ degree F water, my creative mind explodes with ideas.%0a%0aFrom Rick Seaman -- I do my most creative thinking either while, or immediately after, taking a short walk outdoors. Weeding the vegetable garden seems to be a good stimulator as well.%0a%0aFrom Christina M. Hoyt -- Boredom precedes some of my best creative activities. It's the need to concentrate, get going, and make something beautiful.  OR Seeing something someone else has created gets my mind going on variations that I want to create on my own. This includes programming as well as crafts.%0a%0aFrom Denys Laurence -- Getting the little things in life in order and out of the way - changing the light bulb in the garage, getting rid of most of the paper cluttering the desk, getting the photographs into the album, and all the other seemingly insignificant things that make life take up so much time - clears the consciousness for inspiration and my best creative output.%0a%0aFrom Bruce Weaver -- When I need to concentrate and become more creative, I turn on Classical music. Though I normally prefer rock or pop music, when it is time to write for a speaking engagement or a new marketing idea, the classics seem to help me focus and feel more grandiose. Of course I also find that, if for some reason I've not gotten a good night's sleep, that my creativity is more limited due to fatigue.%0a%0aFrom Jim Milner -- In general, I have recognized my most significant creativity stems from prolonged periods of personal pain or discomfort. It is then, after rooting around in those uncomfortable depths of ones soul for answers, that creative essence begins flowing like a natural soothing ointment.%0a%0aFrom J. Nickerson -- Good night's sleep with lots of dreams and indulging in theta-state, reliving and continuing the dream after I have begun to wake (but not quite entirely awake), followed by a shower to crystalize possibilities for action Building off someone else's ideas in a brainstorming session, ultimately being a source for a new idea. Key environmental conditions for best creative output include: trust, safe space, energy, vision, passion, desire, intention, fun, laughter. My courage to be in action in a high risk situation without knowing the outcome.%0a%0aFrom Guido Thys -- If it's an assignment: 47,5 hours of resisting the idea of having to work on it, a sudden shock followed by a stiff shot of adrenalin, 30 minutes of Superman behaviour followed by a sense of guilt ("if I had started earlier, the outcome would have been better" - which is nonsense).%0a%0aFrom Susan in Phoenix -- Immersing myself in pictorial images, eating a superb dinner with good wine, enjoying witty conversation. Generally doing something that greatly heightens at least one of my senses, or gets my brain moving.%0a%0aFrom Walter Aigner -- Going to a large bookstore and *****Buying books**** - Probably to compensate for the drain while giving birth to creative solutions.%0a%0aFrom Jeffrey Olson -- Procrastination. Many of my most successful and satisfying aesthetic and intellectual moments come as an effort to avoid the pain of meeting a major deadline. In the same way that some are motivated to clean their houses, I find that my desire to avoid fuels my ability to create. Fortunately, the satisfaction that I experience from this creative diversion will often provide me with just the right amount of energy and focus to also successfully meet my major project deadline.%0a%0aFrom Jennifer Kutzik -- 1. The chance to "bounce" ideas off receptive individuals-- no ideas too wild, no ideas too silly, no ideas too dumb -- just let them flow.  2. Exercise stimulates my creativity.  3. Creative day-dreaming -- allowing the mind to wander undirected often brings creative solutions.%0a%0aFrom Wheeler -- A walk in damp, green woods clears my head and makes room for new ideas to grow.%0a%0aFrom J. Romito -- My best thinking almost always is preceded by an attempt to capture my thoughts in a clear, coherent narrative explanation of the issue I'm grappling with. In other words, when I try to put it in writing, good things usually happen.%0a%0aFrom Jill Gale de Villa -- 1. Intercourse (in the nonbiblical sense).  2. Getting physical (also in the nonbiblical sense: e.g., traveling, hiking, snorkeling).  3. Research 4. Any other activity that stimulates the use of the muscle between the ears.%0a%0aFrom Bill Schreyer -- Sufficient sleep Relaxation (play) Meditation on the Holy Scriptures Prayer Fasting Seclusion (personal intereaction rest)%0a%0aFrom Cantin Noa Mathieu -- When there is political controversies or popular debate on the news, it always give me full imagination. Social and moral questions so complexes that they hit the imagination. I'm native french speaker, and trying to write in english or in an other language with wich I'm not familiar also wake up my mind.%0a%0aFrom Joyce Wycoff -- Transcontinental flights. I don't know if it's the altitude or being cooped up for six hours with an unlimited supply of magazines, but something happens.  --- Here's more sent Sunday, 10 Dec 1995 Here's a summary of responses to the question of how to create a feast for your creative self.  Hint!! There's a number of terrific ideas for New Year's Resolutions in these responses.  Maybe it's time to take our creativity as seriously as our physical selves.%0a%0aFrom McDargh -- Have an informal picnic and invite two precocious six year olds, President Clinton, Bob Dole, Einstein, Ghandi, and Madame Curie. Ask them to dialogue on what they want in the future for the world (not for them individually) and then dialogue on how can they best help each other get there! The six year olds would draw pictures also of what they think the adults are saying.%0a%0aFrom Donald Gauger -- Begin with a good sized library; high ceiling with candle lit crystal chandeliers, good sized fireplace, rose window to the South, a large North window opening on to a expansive countryside view. Side boards are filled with intriguing foods and drink. Add groups of comfortable chairs, couches, and sturdy tables piled with paper, pens, paints, canvases, toys, puzzles, clay, musical instruments, sculpture, flowers, and more books. Fill the room with friends, family, artists, scientists, poets, engineers, musicians, architects, actors, models, children, and lovers. Invite me, and I may never leave.%0a%0aFrom Linda Wargo -- Going to my stained glass studio and making stuff! Hiking in the woods. Tap dancing. Gardening. Yoga. Meditating. Yummmmmm!%0a%0aFrom Kathryn Dickenson -- My creative banquet would begin with a clearing in the forest.  I would then add a small, joyful stream. A hammock with a clear view of the stars and clouds would be my resting place. My ears would feast on the conversation of God's creatures. My soul and mind would be refreshed with peace.%0a%0aFrom Susan L. Williams -- I would spend hours playing thinking games with really creative people.%0a%0aFrom Vella Mahaney -- I'd rent a room without walls. . . serve an appetizer of Robin Williams on a wild comedy riff. . . . dance with a bandon. . .  . scuffle leaves, shift gears, play the pennywhistle and sit amongst piles of colored paper, bits of fabric, pens & crayons, scissors and pots of glue. And, of course, I'd invite the planet.%0a%0aFrom Rick Seaman -- Replete with mixed metaphors and malapropisms, I would set upon the trestle-board a juicy conumdrum to nibble at. Upon developing a thirst for a solution, I would take up the gauntlet and drink in the possibilities. After satiating my appitite for the beast, I would ruminate on the possibilities.  Then, following a time of sub-conscious consideration, relaxed reflection with some fellow nuts and spirits would most likely yield a most satisfactory conclusion.%0a%0aFrom Jeffrey Hyman -- I'd phone one of my silliest friends and play with words for a while (or a whale)!!%0a%0aFrom Sharon Wright -- Go for a walk in the woods and collect pine cones, seed pods, acorns, walnuts, milkweed,...interesting bits and pieces of nature. Bring them all home and spread them out on a large table. Cut large circles out of stiff cardboard and cut a ring out of the center and create Christmas wreaths for all your friends and family members using all the neat stuff you collected arranged in a creative fashion.%0a%0aFrom D'Angelo -- Visit art galleries and museums. Let the images (colors & textures) bathe your mind. Don't study. Don't think. Just experience.%0a%0aFrom the Unknown Fisherman -- Immersed waist deep in the Smith River, the last free flowing river in California. With its soul telegraphing on the end of a fishing line. And me in anticipation of the mystical and elusive Steelhead. This a full plate of delicacies from God.%0a%0aFrom Wayne S. Mery -- Spend time playing and making up games with your (or someone else's) pre-teenagers. They've got some of the greatest creative minds around. A quiet 1/2 hour walk in the woods.%0a%0aFrom Rich Sojka -- Reflect on the mischief that you got into when you were a child. Think about the life skills you learned when you got into mischief as a kid. When I was a kid I accidently drank gasoline out of a beer can when I was three years old. Perhaps, this explains why I don't drink that much now a days. The story that goes with this incident is OH! SO FUNNY! When I think of this when I'm having a bad day, suddenly things pop back into perspective. I even still become quite mischievous even today.  Actually, mischief is my passion. Try a feast of mischief.  >From Joan Silsby -- First, I'd create the perfect atmosphere for my creative self. Whenever I sit down to write, it always complains about something: it's tired, or it needs to go to the bathroom, or the chair's not comfortable, or it needs a glass of water, or the room's too hot... I'd rectify every single one of those things; and throw some good music and yummy finger-food. Then, I'd give it a play-project -- something completely pointless and pressure-free, like fixing what went wrong with ''Batman Forever'', or writing a sequel to ''Hamlet''.%0a%0aFrom Paul Cosgrave -- The first critical component for the creativity banquet would be time to think. In today's busy world the creativity juices can't flow without time to think. The second most critical component is freedom from prejudices and an ability to open ones mind to all possible ideas. Lastly, and perhaps most important is the courage to carry out ones convictions.%0a%0aFrom Craig Mostowy -- I would dawn my scuba gear and watch and study the surrounding plant and fish life around me to get my creativity juices going.%0a%0aFrom Brenda Daverin -- I'd spend a long weekend surrounded by my most creative friends and various professionals in my favorite field of endeavor. I'd also deliberately deprive myself of sleep, which really jump-starts my brain. I just did all of that, in fact -- it's called going to a science fiction convention! I got home from one last night and came up with three drawings AND a new character to write stories about, all in the space of an hour.  I'd have done more, but I had to go to bed so I could keep up at my day job.%0a%0aFrom Charlotte Kostka -- I surround myself with the following: music, strands of colorful textured yarn, lists of words, funny pictures, scented candles, a big window overlooking a birdfeeder.%0a%0aFrom Ed Golden -- My creative juices start flowing when I deliberately decide to do something 180 degrees opposite from what I would normally do including things that I think I would hate! From something as simple as driving a different way to work in the morning, to river rafting, parachuting, going to a biker's bar, etc.  Something that I may never want to do again but am challenged to try one time. To get out of your rut you have to experience someone else's rut.  >From Ann Carli -- Menu For Creativity Feast ''Appetizer: '' Sensory Pleasures: Elizabethan theater music to set the mood, an arrangement of flowers and berries and leaves an aromatic oak fire, a heavy goblet of good wine ''First Course: '' Stimulating laughter through puns, loving teasing, witticisms ''Second Course: '' Sharing fascinating information, that will be remembered ''Third Course: '' Recounting meaningful experiences that changed one's life ''Fourth Course: '' Exploring ideas, plans, dreams, fantasies ''Fifth Course: '' Appreciating the feast, each other, and life%0a%0aFrom DesireFla a feast for my mind would include a cup of coffee (for my body), and a program on A&E or the Discovery Channel (who says tv is nothing but junk ?). Watching always stimulates me, and makes me want to learn more. I normally end up in the library or online trying to research the info i have just obtained.%0a%0aFrom WiccaF -- My creativity feast would have me and a special group of friends together in a room filled with light, filled with all the items and all the space necessary to do art or to play or do any project under the sun. A collaboration of ideas, a sumptuous gathering of all types and ages of folks, brought together to come up with a unified joint production, with all the time in the world for us to create and materialize our plans into reality.%0a%0aFrom GoBoyd-- ...to look at the people that I am close to and to see something in them that I haven't noticed before.%0a%0aFrom Mary Anne Lindskog -- To create a feast for my creative spirit, I would play soft and beautiful music while I sat back in a comfortable, supportive chair and did progressive relaxation for about ten minutes (the "first course"). Next ("main course"), I would look through the ''Mindmapping'' book, and then I would lean back, close my eyes, and just let my mind wander with the question at hand. Then I would write down all my ideas about the question, trying to see it as different people would see it. For "dessert" I would put on some country western music and dance!%0a%0aFrom Nancy Lorieau -- "How shall I prepare a feast to wake up creativity?" I ask my brain, and brain says "It is done." "The table's set, the meal prepared and all around are your companions.  "Just your gratitude is needed, that is all.  "Know this and sing your song with deep appreciation for the beauty and the joy, the nourishment for each creation, safety to become ...  and freedom to express."  >From Laurel Wheeler -- Changes and growth in my creativity usually come more readily when I am introduced something new into my life. It could be learning of a new artist or a new form of movement or play.  Sometimes, something as simple as sitting in a different chair can bring that shift in view and perspective that is needed.  Mainly, the introduction of a simple, unexpected thing that shifts my perspective gives me cause to create.%0a%0aFrom Brian Tillotson -- I'd select ten science fiction novels by diverse authors and read them all in a week.%0a%0aFrom George X. Kambic -- Play time silly putty A better understanding of quantum mechanics A cruise ship A list of "opposite" words No more than a half a bottle of good wine People who like to play word games.%0a%0aFrom Ted Agresta -- Though not a beaver, I'd start my feast with several stout oak branches. I'd carve a face on one end of each, so my friends could have a quiet companion to lean upon as they wandered the Wisconsin woods. Then they could have some of me with them too.%0a%0aFrom Dave Schoof -- For a feast, not just a snack, I would: Gather up my favorite CDs, artwork, and choice momentos of other creative accomplishments, and head off to a deserted beach house. Long walks in the surf to clear my mind and get peaceful, would be followed by spreading paper, watercolors, and pencils all around the floor in front of a roaring fireplace. After some meditating, non stop background music, and occasional sips of a nice Burgundy playful creating would occur. Then, I would pick a challenge, a new direction, a project to be created, and I would brainstorm, mapping the ideas on paper. Out of a very intense session, I would have a finished plan for a new direction or project that was brought to life and a schedule to implement it. I would follow with some playtime alone, and later, invite friends for a celebration.  That is a feast: nourishing, satisfying and fun.%0a%0aFrom Mike Schultz -- The menu for my creative banquet is good books, good music, good friends and great conversation.%0a%0aFrom Unknown -- The best feast for me to feed my creativity would be one I shared with my brightest friends. I'm at my most creative when I'm chatting with people, the ideas flying back and forth. "As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another," says the good book.%0a%0aFrom Yvonne Hansen -- My creative self hears fine East Indian or Native American music, smells gently cooking foods, and incense. Flickering candlelight makes shadows on warm pink, earth-plaster walls the walls. I am at home, sitting among friends, exchanging ideas, tossing our stimulating comments. Paintings, photographs, sculpture surround us. Books about visual things - art, architecture, graphic arts, crafts, thinking visually - ideas, ecology, development, planning, cognitive topics, history, government, are on tables. Sketch tablets, crayons, watercolors, brushes are available. Some of us draw and doodle.%0a%0aFrom Unknown -- Take the 3 initials of your favorite person's name and create a phrase that fits that person's character, profession, what the person is like or what he/she likes. Then send your creation to them... For instance, Be Ingeniously Creative.%0a%0aFrom Michael Burrell -- The appetizer would be a visual assimilation of Gods work. To gaze upon the wonder of a sunrise, theican; lots of papers for me to draw and a word processor to write; access to the Internet and, last but not least, my friends gathered around the table.%0a%0aFrom Arn Specter -- I give thanks for the knowledge and understanding that soon this world, Mother Earth, will be filled with the Universal energies of Light and Love, for all life forms who choose peace, goodwill, love and harmony to live by.%0a%0aFrom Frederico Augusto de Castro Furtado -- Almost every sci-fi/fantasy novel, movie, TV series or comic ever made; multiple copies of Scientific American; lots of papers for me to draw and a word processor to write; access to the Internet and, last but not least, my friends gathered around the table.%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a

Weeding the vegetable garden seems to be a good stimulator as well.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Christina M. Hoyt -- Boredom precedes some of my best creative activities. It's the need to concentrate, get going, and make something beautiful.  OR Seeing something someone else has created gets my mind going on variations that I want to create on my own. This includes programming as well as crafts.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Denys Laurence -- Getting the little things in life in order and out of the way - changing the light bulb in the garage, getting rid of most of the paper cluttering the desk, getting the photographs into the album, and all the other seemingly insignificant things that make life take up so much time - clears the consciousness for inspiration and my best creative output.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Bruce Weaver -- When I need to concentrate and become more creative, I turn on Classical music. Though I normally prefer rock or pop music, when it is time to write for a speaking engagement or a new marketing idea, the classics seem to help me focus and feel more grandiose. Of course I also find that, if for some reason I've not gotten a good night's sleep, that my creativity is more limited due to fatigue.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Jim Milner -- In general, I have recognized my most significant creativity stems from prolonged periods of personal pain or discomfort. It is then, after rooting around in those uncomfortable depths of ones soul for answers, that creative essence begins flowing like a natural soothing ointment.%0a%3c %0a%3c From J. Nickerson -- Good night's sleep with lots of dreams and indulging in theta-state, reliving and continuing the dream after I have begun to wake (but not quite entirely awake), followed by a shower to crystalize possibilities for action Building off someone else's ideas in a brainstorming session, ultimately being a source for a new idea. Key environmental conditions for best creative output include: trust, safe space, energy, vision, passion, desire, intention, fun, laughter. My courage to be in action in a high risk situation without knowing the outcome.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Guido Thys -- If it's an assignment: 47,5 hours of resisting the idea of having to work on it, a sudden shock followed by a stiff shot of adrenalin, 30 minutes of Superman behaviour followed by a sense of guilt ("if I had started earlier, the outcome would have been better" - which is nonsense).%0a%3c %0a%3c From Susan in Phoenix -- Immersing myself in pictorial images, eating a superb dinner with good wine, enjoying witty conversation. Generally doing something that greatly heightens at least one of my senses, or gets my brain moving.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Walter Aigner -- Going to a large bookstore and *****Buying books**** - Probably to compensate for the drain while giving birth to creative solutions.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Jeffrey Olson -- Procrastination. Many of my most successful and satisfying aesthetic and intellectual moments come as an effort to avoid the pain of meeting a major deadline. In the same way that some are motivated to clean their houses, I find that my desire to avoid fuels my ability to create. Fortunately, the satisfaction that I experience from this creative diversion will often provide me with just the right amount of energy and focus to also successfully meet my major project deadline.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Jennifer Kutzik -- 1. The chance to "bounce" ideas off receptive individuals-- no ideas too wild, no ideas too silly, no ideas too dumb -- just let them flow.  2. Exercise stimulates my creativity.  3. Creative day-dreaming -- allowing the mind to wander undirected often brings creative solutions.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Wheeler -- A walk in damp, green woods clears my head and makes room for new ideas to grow.%0a%3c %0a%3c From J. Romito -- My best thinking almost always is preceded by an attempt to capture my thoughts in a clear, coherent narrative explanation of the issue I'm grappling with. In other words, when I try to put it in writing, good things usually happen.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Jill Gale de Villa -- 1. Intercourse (in the nonbiblical sense).  2. Getting physical (also in the nonbiblical sense: e.g., traveling, hiking, snorkeling).  3. Research 4. Any other activity that stimulates the use of the muscle between the ears.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Bill Schreyer -- Sufficient sleep Relaxation (play) Meditation on the Holy Scriptures Prayer Fasting Seclusion (personal intereaction rest)%0a%3c %0a%3c From Cantin Noa Mathieu -- When there is political controversies or popular debate on the news, it always give me full imagination. Social and moral questions so complexes that they hit the imagination. I'm native french speaker, and trying to write in english or in an other language with wich I'm not familiar also wake up my mind.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Joyce Wycoff -- Transcontinental flights. I don't know if it's the altitude or being cooped up for six hours with an unlimited supply of magazines, but something happens.  --- Here's more sent Sunday, 10 Dec 1995 Here's a summary of responses to the question of how to create a feast for your creative self.  Hint!! There's a number of terrific ideas for New Year's Resolutions in these responses.  Maybe it's time to take our creativity as seriously as our physical selves.%0a%3c %0a%3c From McDargh -- Have an informal picnic and invite two precocious six year olds, President Clinton, Bob Dole, Einstein, Ghandi, and Madame Curie. Ask them to dialogue on what they want in the future for the world (not for them individually) and then dialogue on how can they best help each other get there! The six year olds would draw pictures also of what they think the adults are saying.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Donald Gauger -- Begin with a good sized library; high ceiling with candle lit crystal chandeliers, good sized fireplace, rose window to the South, a large North window opening on to a expansive countryside view. Side boards are filled with intriguing foods and drink. Add groups of comfortable chairs, couches, and sturdy tables piled with paper, pens, paints, canvases, toys, puzzles, clay, musical instruments, sculpture, flowers, and more books. Fill the room with friends, family, artists, scientists, poets, engineers, musicians, architects, actors, models, children, and lovers. Invite me, and I may never leave.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Linda Wargo -- Going to my stained glass studio and making stuff! Hiking in the woods. Tap dancing. Gardening. Yoga. Meditating. Yummmmmm!%0a%3c %0a%3c From Kathryn Dickenson -- My creative banquet would begin with a clearing in the forest.  I would then add a small, joyful stream. A hammock with a clear view of the stars and clouds would be my resting place. My ears would feast on the conversation of God's creatures. My soul and mind would be refreshed with peace.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Susan L. Williams -- I would spend hours playing thinking games with really creative people.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Vella Mahaney -- I'd rent a room without walls. . . serve an appetizer of Robin Williams on a wild comedy riff. . . . dance with a bandon. . .  . scuffle leaves, shift gears, play the pennywhistle and sit amongst piles of colored paper, bits of fabric, pens & crayons, scissors and pots of glue. And, of course, I'd invite the planet.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Rick Seaman -- Replete with mixed metaphors and malapropisms, I would set upon the trestle-board a juicy conumdrum to nibble at. Upon developing a thirst for a solution, I would take up the gauntlet and drink in the possibilities. After satiating my appitite for the beast, I would ruminate on the possibilities.  Then, following a time of sub-conscious consideration, relaxed reflection with some fellow nuts and spirits would most likely yield a most satisfactory conclusion.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Jeffrey Hyman -- I'd phone one of my silliest friends and play with words for a while (or a whale)!!%0a%3c %0a%3c From Sharon Wright -- Go for a walk in the woods and collect pine cones, seed pods, acorns, walnuts, milkweed,...interesting bits and pieces of nature. Bring them all home and spread them out on a large table. Cut large circles out of stiff cardboard and cut a ring out of the center and create Christmas wreaths for all your friends and family members using all the neat stuff you collected arranged in a creative fashion.%0a%3c %0a%3c From D'Angelo -- Visit art galleries and museums. Let the images (colors & textures) bathe your mind. Don't study. Don't think. Just experience.%0a%3c %0a%3c From the Unknown Fisherman -- Immersed waist deep in the Smith River, the last free flowing river in California. With its soul telegraphing on the end of a fishing line. And me in anticipation of the mystical and elusive Steelhead. This a full plate of delicacies from God.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Wayne S. Mery -- Spend time playing and making up games with your (or someone else's) pre-teenagers. They've got some of the greatest creative minds around. A quiet 1/2 hour walk in the woods.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Rich Sojka -- Reflect on the mischief that you got into when you were a child. Think about the life skills you learned when you got into mischief as a kid. When I was a kid I accidently drank gasoline out of a beer can when I was three years old. Perhaps, this explains why I don't drink that much now a days. The story that goes with this incident is OH! SO FUNNY! When I think of this when I'm having a bad day, suddenly things pop back into perspective. I even still become quite mischievous even today.  Actually, mischief is my passion. Try a feast of mischief.  >From Joan Silsby -- First, I'd create the perfect atmosphere for my creative self. Whenever I sit down to write, it always complains about something: it's tired, or it needs to go to the bathroom, or the chair's not comfortable, or it needs a glass of water, or the room's too hot... I'd rectify every single one of those things; and throw some good music and yummy finger-food. Then, I'd give it a play-project -- something completely pointless and pressure-free, like fixing what went wrong with ''Batman Forever'', or writing a sequel to ''Hamlet''.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Paul Cosgrave -- The first critical component for the creativity banquet would be time to think. In today's busy world the creativity juices can't flow without time to think. The second most critical component is freedom from prejudices and an ability to open ones mind to all possible ideas. Lastly, and perhaps most important is the courage to carry out ones convictions.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Craig Mostowy -- I would dawn my scuba gear and watch and study the surrounding plant and fish life around me to get my creativity juices going.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Brenda Daverin -- I'd spend a long weekend surrounded by my most creative friends and various professionals in my favorite field of endeavor. I'd also deliberately deprive myself of sleep, which really jump-starts my brain. I just did all of that, in fact -- it's called going to a science fiction convention! I got home from one last night and came up with three drawings AND a new character to write stories about, all in the space of an hour.  I'd have done more, but I had to go to bed so I could keep up at my day job.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Charlotte Kostka -- I surround myself with the following: music, strands of colorful textured yarn, lists of words, funny pictures, scented candles, a big window overlooking a birdfeeder.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Ed Golden -- My creative juices start flowing when I deliberately decide to do something 180 degrees opposite from what I would normally do including things that I think I would hate! From something as simple as driving a different way to work in the morning, to river rafting, parachuting, going to a biker's bar, etc.  Something that I may never want to do again but am challenged to try one time. To get out of your rut you have to experience someone else's rut.  >From Ann Carli -- Menu For Creativity Feast ''Appetizer: '' Sensory Pleasures: Elizabethan theater music to set the mood, an arrangement of flowers and berries and leaves an aromatic oak fire, a heavy goblet of good wine ''First Course: '' Stimulating laughter through puns, loving teasing, witticisms ''Second Course: '' Sharing fascinating information, that will be remembered ''Third Course: '' Recounting meaningful experiences that changed one's life ''Fourth Course: '' Exploring ideas, plans, dreams, fantasies ''Fifth Course: '' Appreciating the feast, each other, and life%0a%3c %0a%3c From DesireFla a feast for my mind would include a cup of coffee (for my body), and a program on A&E or the Discovery Channel (who says tv is nothing but junk ?). Watching always stimulates me, and makes me want to learn more. I normally end up in the library or online trying to research the info i have just obtained.%0a%3c %0a%3c From WiccaF -- My creativity feast would have me and a special group of friends together in a room filled with light, filled with all the items and all the space necessary to do art or to play or do any project under the sun. A collaboration of ideas, a sumptuous gathering of all types and ages of folks, brought together to come up with a unified joint production, with all the time in the world for us to create and materialize our plans into reality.%0a%3c %0a%3c From GoBoyd-- ...to look at the people that I am close to and to see something in them that I haven't noticed before.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Mary Anne Lindskog -- To create a feast for my creative spirit, I would play soft and beautiful music while I sat back in a comfortable, supportive chair and did progressive relaxation for about ten minutes (the "first course"). Next ("main course"), I would look through the ''Mindmapping'' book, and then I would lean back, close my eyes, and just let my mind wander with the question at hand. Then I would write down all my ideas about the question, trying to see it as different people would see it. For "dessert" I would put on some country western music and dance!%0a%3c %0a%3c From Nancy Lorieau -- "How shall I prepare a feast to wake up creativity?" I ask my brain, and brain says "It is done." "The table's set, the meal prepared and all around are your companions.  "Just your gratitude is needed, that is all.  "Know this and sing your song with deep appreciation for the beauty and the joy, the nourishment for each creation, safety to become ...  and freedom to express."  >From Laurel Wheeler -- Changes and growth in my creativity usually come more readily when I am introduced something new into my life. It could be learning of a new artist or a new form of movement or play.  Sometimes, something as simple as sitting in a different chair can bring that shift in view and perspective that is needed.  Mainly, the introduction of a simple, unexpected thing that shifts my perspective gives me cause to create.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Brian Tillotson -- I'd select ten science fiction novels by diverse authors and read them all in a week.%0a%3c %0a%3c From George X. Kambic -- Play time silly putty A better understanding of quantum mechanics A cruise ship A list of "opposite" words No more than a half a bottle of good wine People who like to play word games.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Ted Agresta -- Though not a beaver, I'd start my feast with several stout oak branches. I'd carve a face on one end of each, so my friends could have a quiet companion to lean upon as they wandered the Wisconsin woods. Then they could have some of me with them too.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Dave Schoof -- For a feast, not just a snack, I would: Gather up my favorite CDs, artwork, and choice momentos of other creative accomplishments, and head off to a deserted beach house. Long walks in the surf to clear my mind and get peaceful, would be followed by spreading paper, watercolors, and pencils all around the floor in front of a roaring fireplace. After some meditating, non stop background music, and occasional sips of a nice Burgundy playful creating would occur. Then, I would pick a challenge, a new direction, a project to be created, and I would brainstorm, mapping the ideas on paper. Out of a very intense session, I would have a finished plan for a new direction or project that was brought to life and a schedule to implement it. I would follow with some playtime alone, and later, invite friends for a celebration.  That is a feast: nourishing, satisfying and fun.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Mike Schultz -- The menu for my creative banquet is good books, good music, good friends and great conversation.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Unknown -- The best feast for me to feed my creativity would be one I shared with my brightest friends. I'm at my most creative when I'm chatting with people, the ideas flying back and forth. "As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another," says the good book.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Yvonne Hansen -- My creative self hears fine East Indian or Native American music, smells gently cooking foods, and incense. Flickering candlelight makes shadows on warm pink, earth-plaster walls the walls. I am at home, sitting among friends, exchanging ideas, tossing our stimulating comments. Paintings, photographs, sculpture surround us. Books about visual things - art, architecture, graphic arts, crafts, thinking visually - ideas, ecology, development, planning, cognitive topics, history, government, are on tables. Sketch tablets, crayons, watercolors, brushes are available. Some of us draw and doodle.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Unknown -- Take the 3 initials of your favorite person's name and create a phrase that fits that person's character, profession, what the person is like or what he/she likes. Then send your creation to them... For instance, Be Ingeniously Creative.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Michael Burrell -- The appetizer would be a visual assimilation of Gods work. To gaze upon the wonder of a sunrise, theican; lots of papers for me to draw and a word processor to write; access to the Internet and, last but not least, my friends gathered around the table.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Arn Specter -- I give thanks for the knowledge and understanding that soon this world, Mother Earth, will be filled with the Universal energies of Light and Love, for all life forms who choose peace, goodwill, love and harmony to live by.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Frederico Augusto de Castro Furtado -- Almost every sci-fi/fantasy novel, movie, TV series or comic ever made; multiple copies of Scientific American; lots of papers for me to draw and a word processor to write; access to the Internet and, last but not least, my friends gathered around the table.%0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a

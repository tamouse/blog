His adventuring behavior has been corrected from time to time, for not being appropriate for a dungeon delve. The list is almost entirely composed of The Word he was given as a response to an action or event he was involved with. %0a# After the &#34;Dark Vessel&#34; adventure, everyone who ever loved me is dead. I'm not allowed to brag about that anymore. %0a# Aftershave is not to be applied with a putty knife. %0a# Although I do think I could do a better job and I would like to lead, these questions usually turn out not to be sincere. %0a# Anything I say after &#34;it's worth noting&#34; is usually not interesting to anyone else in the party. %0a# Basilisks cannot be hypnotized by winning a staring contest with them. %0a# Battle axes are not the sniper's weapon of choice so I should get off the roof and engage the enemy. %0a# Battle axes don't have a stun setting. %0a# Clerics can move in all directions, not just diagonally. %0a# Clerics that are dragged to a tavern for a night of celebratory quaffing should be returned to their devotions within 4 to 6 working days (or within two High Holy Days, whichever comes first). %0a# Dark Gods require virgin sacrifices; incantations do not require virgin spell components. It is wrong to ask the mage how he knows his frog's eyes come from a virgin frog. %0a# Draft horses are not missile weapons. %0a# Dragon breath is not funny. %0a# Dragons do not dispense their hoard in lotteries, and there's no way I &#34;may already be a winner.&#34; %0a# 'Dropping Trou&#34; is not a fighter class &#34;special attack.&#34; %0a# Elf ears do not require sharpening. %0a# For all that he's an illiterate man, the seneschal can read me like a book. %0a# For customs inspectors, &#34;Declare&#34; has a specific meaning that does not involve reciting my heritage back to the &#34;Time Of Troubles.&#34; %0a# Get down off the altar. %0a# Gifts from The Gods do not come with an exchange coupon for Harrod's Mercantile and Chandler shop. %0a# God-calls are not protected as Free Speech. %0a# He did not &#34;start it.&#34; %0a# He is not kidding. %0a# He is not on &#34;my side of the dungeon.&#34; %0a# He really means it this time. %0a# Holy Relics of Fantastic Power do not have a shelf-life date. %0a# &#34;Hungry&#34; is not an alignment. %0a# Neither is &#34;stupid,&#34; but in my case, they're willing to make an exception. %0a# I am not allowed to make explosives, even if I do have all the supplies. %0a# I am not allowed to render any member of my party to obtain those supplies. %0a# I am not the default love interest and should stay away from any non-dwarf royalty we encounter. %0a# I am not the evil twin, but only because I don't have a twin. %0a# I am not the Grey Poupon distributor for the kingdom, and I cannot ladle it onto the illusionist and offer him to dragons as a free sample. %0a# I am not the Grey Poupon distributor for the kingdom, and I should stop giving dragons a discount on the stuff. %0a# I am not the rightful heir to the Burger King, I'm just telling a whopper. %0a# I cannot improve my defenses by writing &#34;-10 Armor Class&#34; on my shirt. %0a# I don't get to keep chaotic monsters that followed me home unless I intend to skin them. %0a# I don't know what I was thinking when I said the longbowman was &#34;out of ammo&#34; after six shots. %0a# I don't want you to turn this adventure around. %0a# I should stop screaming about &#34;the power of grayskull&#34; and take cover from the crossbows. %0a# I should stop writing &#34;Bite Me&#34; in orcish on my party leader's shield. %0a# Must stop writing ANYTHING in orcish on party members&#34; shields. %0a# &#34;I was bored&#34; is not an excuse for anything done with a loaded ballista. %0a# I was not placed in charge of the prisoners so that I could slaughter them and &#34;the paladin wouldn't get his hands dirty.&#34; %0a# I was not seduced by the Demon Queen of Pormax, and the scars from that adventure are not &#34;love tattoos.&#34; %0a# If I sing &#34;I'm A Lumberjack and I'm Okay&#34; just one more time, they're gonna make me eat my axe. %0a# If it looked like a duck, quacked like a duck, and tasted like a duck, but had a collar indicating it's sacred to a local goddess, we should skip dessert and start running. %0a# In joining a group of adventurers, the party leader does actually become the boss of me, and I should respond accordingly in combat. %0a# In my case, &#34;innocent until proven guilty&#34; is an offense against the gods. %0a# In my case, an aphorism indicating &#34;that's when you find out who your friends really are&#34; is just noise in the wind. %0a# Inquisitors have no sense of humor. They also don't like this fact pointed out to them. %0a# It is wrong to greet Inquisitors by shouting &#34;stick to the story!&#34; to other party members. %0a# It is not motivational to talk about adventure parties that died in situations &#34;just like this.&#34; %0a# It is so my fault. %0a# It is wrong to enhance my codpiece for dramatic effect. %0a# It is wrong to make the evil sorceress cry by mentioning her biological clock, ticking away. %0a# The cleric feels it is wrong to behead someone who's crying. Noted. %0a# It is wrong to splice centerfolds into the mage's grimoires. %0a# It is wrong to tell dying heroes they've been downsized and their valuables seized. %0a# It is wrong to use exploding shuriken to gather firewood when there's a Druid in the party. %0a# It is wrong to write &#34;First come, first serve&#34; on the wagon when we're hired to protect the tax collector. %0a# It would not have worked if it weren't for those meddling kids. %0a# It's a Monarchy based on Oral Law. There is no Free Speech. %0a# It's never too early to tell the others where I packed the healing potions. %0a# Labels on the vials of potions are not the sign of a weak mind, they're really a good idea. %0a# Labels on the vials of potions should be popular names in a common tongue, not pictionary graphics. %0a# Evidently I cannot draw a clear &#34;healer&#34; to save my life. %0a# It's not important who's right and who's wrong as long as the party leader is right. %0a# Jousting is the sport of knights on horseback, not dwarves on dining tables. %0a# Kilroy was NOT here and he'd better stop putting graffiti in the castle. %0a# Knowing how to burp fire and NEEDING to burp fire are two different things. %0a# Knowing three swear words in thieves cant does not make me a dual class fighter/thief. %0a# Leave the animation of the dead to professionals. %0a# Leave the noble art of chirurgery to the professionals. %0a# Magic wands do not experience &#34;recoil&#34; so I don't need to brace the short-skirted sorceress every time she casts a spell. %0a# Membership in the waterferryman's guild does not allow me to charge passengers for space on a lifeboat. %0a# Mirrored sun glasses are not period ware. %0a# Missile weapons and alcohol don't mix. %0a# Most characters that claim to be invincible don't understand what the word means. %0a# Must never use the word &#34;wanker&#34; within 50 feet of a cleric attempting to invoke or influence her deity. %0a# Must not delay the party's attack on the fire dragon while I &#34;get the s'mores ready.&#34; %0a# Must not hire a soapmaker to make a half-ton cake of soap, attach axles, and drive it to the king's castle as a gift &#34;from concerned friends.&#34; %0a# Ditto the alchemist, half ton breathmint, the queen, &#34;loving but scandalized subjects.&#34; %0a# Must not hire ladies of negotiable affections to follow the cleric back to his temple and commend him to the bishop for the sexual healing he performed. %0a# Must not make fun of high-level dark knights who run their own country %0a# ...even if their knight order is named after a flower. %0a# Must not tell the Amazon she needs to get laid. %0a# REALLY must not tell the barbarian fighter that the Amazon needs to get laid. %0a# Must not throw sliced fruit into gelatinous cubes and call it Jell-O. %0a# Must not throw the NPC's into flame traps to &#34;see them sparkle.&#34; %0a# Must put the battle axe down before performing the ancient Dwarven victory rite of &#34;The Barbie Girl Dance.&#34; %0a# Must remember that the time to point out flaws in the strategy is BEFORE we enter the Dark Abyss of Eternal Peril. %0a# Must stop asking if he's making it up as we go along. %0a# Must stop telling the goblins &#34;You might be a redneck if&mdash;&#34; %0a# Must stop trying to crossbreed the mage's familiar with the pack mule. %0a# Must stop trying to get the pack mules to take loyalty oaths. %0a# Must stop using the clich: &#34;Fools gold spends just like real gold in an election year!&#34; %0a# Mustn't wear my &#34;tour guide&#34; cap when we're forced to return to a dungeon for something we forgot. %0a# Not allowed to describe the colorful history of a dungeon if that history was one of our previous adventures. %0a# My horoscope for today does NOT say &#34;it'll be a cold day in hell before I take point.&#34; %0a# My mithril long johns do not grant me power over space, time and reality. %0a# My operatives will not avenge my death and none of them are vulcans. %0a# My primary weapon is not a two-handed shield. %0a# Never answer the question &#34;what else could go wrong&#34; while the `GameMaster is in the room. %0a# Never ask a wizard if they'd rather be a &#34;real man.&#34; %0a# Next time I make that old joke about &#34;poison canyon&mdash;one drop will kill you!&#34; they're throwing me off the bridge. %0a# Next time we run out of torches because I used three of them to light my farts, they're going to set fire to my beard. %0a# No character class has &#34;can o&#34; whup ass&#34; as a weapon of proficiency. %0a# No longer allowed to ask the half-orc where Beavis is. The Oracle told him all about Beavis. %0a# No more Mr. Nice Barbarian. %0a# No one cares how they did it in the old, old, old days. %0a# No one is interested in how I keep my beard so glossy. %0a# No one is interested in who I'm going to hire as my court fool when I am finally rich beyond dreams of avarice. %0a# No one wants to guess what's in my beard. %0a# No one wants to hear about &#34;the lamentation of their women&#34; from someone that's knee-high to a &mdash;.well, to everyone. %0a# No one wants to hear me go on about what they do to you in the drive-through. %0a# No one wants to help me look for my invisible friend. %0a# No one wants to know how the fight would have gone if we were playing with a different rules system. %0a# No one wants to know HOW the velociraptor happened into the prioress&#34; wine cellar; they just expect me to get it out. %0a# No one wants to see a dwarf do a table dance. %0a# No specialty action performed by the thief is improved or enhanced by jostling his elbow and telling him to &#34;get on with it.&#34; %0a# This goes more than double for a visit to the alchemist. %0a# Not allowed to ask Death to prove he's really Death. %0a# Not allowed to beat out the &#34;In A Gada Da Vida&#34; drum solo on the paladin's breastplate. %0a# Not allowed to carry the shoulder-fired catapult indoors every again. %0a# Not allowed to chop an orc's arm off, then carry it on my shoulder as my &#34;familiar.&#34; %0a# Not allowed to confess my sins to the monk in the party.

Well, not anymore. %0a# Paladin party leaders don't have to explain all command decisions, especially to chaotic stupid dwarves. %0a# Putting cotton in my ears does not make me move silently in plate armor. %0a# Religious tracts should not be handed out every time we meet a party of orcs. %0a# Rescuers are there to rescue, not to shout about the cavalry to the rescue, or inquire who ordered extra cheese with anchovies. %0a# She's not playing with me. %0a# Stop adding the notation &#34;forbidden zone&#34; to the maps at random. %0a# Stop chanting &#34;hobbits are the enemy.&#34; %0a# The bishop is not a hood ornament and when he stops screaming I should untie him. %0a# The cleric did not join the party so as to discuss orthodox versus reformed theology with respect to the question of whether toothbrushes clean the souls of our teeth. %0a# The Happy Hunting Grounds do not have a &#34;black tie&#34; policy. %0a# The Healer is a cleric, not a paracleric. %0a# The Paladin's horse is off limits to anyone with a meat cleaver and a bottle of bar-b-q sauce. %0a# The party wizard is not undead, and I must stop congratulating him for &#34;passing&#34; as a living being. %0a# The phrase &#34;can't possibly miss&#34; is way overused. %0a# The wages of sin are NOT &#34;heaps and heaps of slightly smelly treasure.&#34; %0a# There is no instant replay in the dungeon, and the refs will not vindicate my actions. %0a# There is no ominous &#34;background music&#34; telling me the monster's getting closer. %0a# There is no save versus &#34;being an inbred jackass&#34; and I must stop consoling the cavalier on his fumble. %0a# There is no such language as pig-druid, so stop practicing it. %0a# There is nothing under the sorcerer's gown that is of any interest to a fellow party member. %0a# There's no such thing as a Dwarven Death Grip. %0a# Throwing Halflings off a cliff to see how big a splat they make is not a competitive sport. %0a# Not allowed to spend time on watch developing a scoring system for Halfling-splat. %0a# Treason's such a harsh word. %0a# Triage categories are not (1) Me, (2) You all, I guess, and (3) Those other geeks. %0a# Triage is performed according to the nature of the wounds, not the amount of gold they're carrying. %0a# Turns out, the Ranger DOES care what his deity-gift magical arrow was last fired at. %0a# Turns out, when I'm told &#34;you wouldn't dare&#34; they're usually wrong. %0a# Twenty seven lice in my hair and beard do not qualify me as a leader of a guerilla army of infiltration specialists. %0a# Under most circumstances, no one cares to see how many gold pieces I can fit into a goblin's skull. %0a# Unloaded crossbows should not be fired in jest. %0a# Valhalla is not the final destination of those that die owing more than a million gold to creditors. %0a# Violating treaties is not an &#34;icebreaker&#34; for diplomatic missions. %0a# Voices in my head are not &#34;in a position to know.&#34; %0a# War cries should be shouted, not delivered by messenger or sung by off-side cheerleaders. %0a# We did not recruit the Halfling just in case we need a virgin sacrifice. Stop telling him that. %0a# We do not delay returning the princess to the king in order to solicit competing bids. %0a# We do not run credit checks on royalty when hired to rescue the princess. %0a# We do not shout &#34;Circle of Life, Dude!&#34; and leave the wounded behind. %0a# We will not laugh about all of this in a year or two. %0a# We're here to kill orcs, not moon them. %0a# When a party member is beset by multiple opponents, I will render all possible aid. I will never again stand by, telling the rest of the party &#34;He needs to prove himself against the Dragon&mdash;and his own fears.&#34; %0a# When carrying the wounded half-orc back to camp, I should not cut him in two to save the human half first. %0a# When cave bears hit cave bears it means love. When cave bears hit party members it means war, and I should not shout &#34;get a room, you two!'%0a# When Death lets us challenge him in order to stay alive, we will pick a board game, not Whack-A-Toad. %0a# When small harmless people shapechange to large slavering monsters, my most immediate reaction is not to try to calculate just how much mass seems to have been hidden/ignored in the transformation. %0a# When someone says &#34;It's over,&#34; not allowed to tell the cleric it's her cue to sing. %0a# When someone says &#34;some of you, and you know who you are&#34; everyone in the party knows they're looking at me. %0a# When the Oracle offers us the answers to any three questions, not allowed to pull out my Zen For Dummies book and ask about 1 hand clapping. %0a# When the party leader is hanging from the face of the cliff, I must find a rope before starting a &#34;how long can he hold on&#34; pool. %0a# When the reptiloids are sacrificing to their dark gods, and they don't know where the heart is on an elf, I should not whip out a grease pencil and provide visual aids. %0a# When they say "over my dead body" I should assume it's hyperbole until proven to be literal, not the other way around. %0a# When they say &#34;fire at will&#34; they don't mean Lord William. %0a# Wrong to tell the cleric she has exceeded her daily limit on whining. %0a# Xylophone music is not required in order to fight skeletons. %0a# Yes, the hierophant does worship Lacedos God of Light, I should stop asking. %0a# Yes, there really are such things as innocent bystanders. %0a%0a%0a

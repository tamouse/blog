Here we use a mouse model to study the effect on cortical connectivity of disrupting the ASD candidate gene PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10). Through Cre-mediated recombination, we conditionally knocked out PTEN expression in a subset of auditory cortical neurons. Analysis of long-range connectivity using channelrhodopsin-2 revealed that the strength of synaptic inputs from both the contralateral auditory cortex and from the thalamus onto PTEN-cko neurons was enhanced compared with nearby neurons with normal PTEN expression. Laser-scanning photostimulation showed that local inputs onto PTEN-cko neurons in the auditory cortex were similarly enhanced. The hyperconnectivity caused by PTEN-cko could be blocked by rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of the PTEN downstream molecule mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1. Together, our results suggest that local and long-range hyperconnectivity may constitute a physiological basis for the effects of mutations in PTEN and possibly other ASD candidate genes.%0a> >>%3c%3c%0a> %0a> (:linebreaks:)%0a> Received August 31, 2011.%0a> Revision received November 20, 2011.%0a> Accepted December 6, 2011.%0a> Copyright &copy; 2012 the authors 0270-6474/12/321643-10%0a> (:nolinebreaks:)%0a> %0a> [[PubMed Citation -> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22302806?dopt=Abstract]]%0a> %0a> Saved Date: 2012-2-6 11:29%0a> (:linkwikiwords:)%0a

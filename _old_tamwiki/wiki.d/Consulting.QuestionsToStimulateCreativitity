text=!!Questions to Stimulate Creativitity%0a%0a[[#excerpt]]%0aLong-ish email from the Wake-up, Brain mailing list (defunct) where people responded with the questions they ask themselves and others to stimulate creativity.%0a[[#excerptend]]%0a%0a(:source lang=email -getcode header="Email submissions":)%0aWake-up, Brain ... it's Tuesday again! (long weekend ;-)%0aBrought to you by the Innovation Network%0a%0aWe had so many great responses to the request for questions to stimulate%0acreativity that we're going to send them in batches.  Here's the first%0agroup:%0a%0aFrom: Debbie Baker %3cd.baker@NOSPAMix.netcom.com>%0aI don't have five.  I have 2 which work well for me.%0a1 If there were no time or money limitations what would you do?%0a2 When people tell me they don't know what to do, I ask%0a"If you knew what to do, what would it be?"%0a%0aFrom: Phyllis Van %3cpavan@NOSPAMinav.net>%0aTwo of my favorites:%0a1 What do you want that you don't have now?%0a2 What, if it were invented tomorrow, would put you out of business?%0a%0aFrom: DAVID_STRAKER@NOSPAMHP-UnitedKingdom-om1.om.hp.com%0aStarting from Kipling's What/When/Why/Where/Who/(How):%0a1 What have you done today that you have never done before?%0a2 When are you next going to do something different?%0a3 Why are you not doing or thinking something different '''right now'''?%0a4 Where are you going on your holidays? (go somewhere '''different''')%0a5 Who have you helped think differently today?%0a6 How can you become even more creative?%0a%0a(I know you said 5, but I decided to break the rule!)%0a%0aFrom: John M.Trebes %3caffable@NOSPAMc-com.net>%0a%0a* These three questions, in their specific form only came to me late%0a  in my 35 year engineering career in the Space business. How I wish%0a  they had been trained into from early on, and continuously%0a  thereafter.%0a%0a1. Give me five different ways that this (device, item, item) can be "broken".%0a%0aNot only will one become more intimately acquainted with the "item" than%0athey have ever been before, they will now be faced with the challenges to%0ato exercise their "creativity" coming up with ways to re-design the "item"%0ato keep it from being broken in ways they have never thought of before.%0a(Note:  I only heard this challenge stated openly as I reached the end of%0amy career in the Space business.  We, collectively were doing this, though%0anot with the conscious intent of discovering ways to break an item.  We%0adid test items extensively to see if they would perform within the%0aboundaries of a set of specifications as contrasted to looking for ways%0athe item could be broken by 'surprise or the unexpected source".)%0a%0a2  "Now that you have your (problem statement, mission statement, etc)%0agive me ten 'assumptions' implicit in the (problem statement, mission%0astatement, etc)."%0a%0a3  Create a five or ten minute "lesson plan", and present it,  on how you%0awould teach this concept to" a grade school class and a high school class.%0a(Note: I have been asked this and I did it.  It was a memorable%0aexperience. I profited greatly from this experience.)%0a%0aFrom: Mike %3cgj1335@NOSPAMhotmail.com>%0a1 How do YOU think we should do this?%0a2 What would make this work more fun AND faster?%0a3 If you had my job, what would you do differently?%0a4 How would YOU recommend we improve quality?%0a5 If this were "the last minute" would you do this assignment%0adifferently?%0a%0aFrom: serge serge@NOSPAMcistron.nl%0aI am really curious to see the answers.%0aMy suggestions:%0a1 "In how many ways can we ....". The classic brainstorm question.%0a2 "This is a really difficult problem and I am sure many other%0aorganizations have to deal with it. Can you address this problem?" In%0athis way you instantly rise above the case itself, suggesting looking for%0areferences, (improving on) proven methods, and a recognition that the%0awork to be done is not trivial.%0a3 "... Solve this problem. Forever." Now it's obvious somebody wants this%0asolved very badly. And you give every freedom to do it.%0a%0aFrom: Rolf Smith %3cthinking@NOSPAMonramp.net>%0aTwo of my favorite questions to get people thinking about thinking...%0a1 What's something you don't know?%0a2 What's a thought you've never thought before?%0a%0aFrom: Mark Smith %3cmarks@NOSPAMmsi-uk.com>%0aTony Robbins poses some powerful questions which can help ignite%0acreativity:%0a1 "What is great about this problem?"%0a1 "How can I use this (situation, challenge etc) to improve ...?"%0a%0aMy favourite is:%0a1 "What would I do, if I knew I couldn't fail?"%0a%0a%0a%0aFrom: "Giampoli, Debra" %3cdgiampoli@NOSPAMkraft.com>%0aHere are some questions I might ask my staff if I were trying to inspire%0athem to be more creative:%0a%0a* What might we do that would create "buzz value" among our customers%0aand competitors?%0a* How would Disney approach this challenge?%0a* How many other ways could we think about this?%0a* What might we do if money, time, and politics were no object?%0a* How many ways can you think of to reframe the challenge?%0a* What outcome would you be really proud of at the end of this%0aproject?%0a* What outcome might create an audible "WOW" in the organization?%0a%0aFrom: Vanda North %3cVANDANORTH@NOSPAMcompuserve.com>%0aThe questions I would ask are:%0a1 "What do you need to make  (X) it happen?"%0a2 "There are limitless resourses, now, what will you do?"%0a3 "If you were Leonardo da Vinci, how would you manage it?"%0a4 "They say this is impossible, and that we certainly can not do%0ait.................??!!"%0a5 "Go where-ever you relax best, and see what pops into your%0amind?!"%0a%0aFrom: Bob Barlow %3crbarlow@NOSPAMfrontiernet.net>%0aIn the introduction to my book, Bob Barlow's Book of Brain Boosters%0a(Scholastic), I thank my late father for posing the question that sparked%0amy lifelong love of creativity. I was about five years old when he looked%0ame in the eye and asked, "Bob, how do you throw away a garbage can?"%0a%0aDad wasn't looking for an answer, of course; there is no "right" answer.%0aHe just wanted to get me thinking -- which he did -- and that has made%0aall the difference. Bob Barlow, sixth grade teacher.%0a%0aFrom: Anne Robinson %3canniecreate@NOSPAMhotmail.com>%0aFive possible questions which would get me going.  Might%0anot others.%0a* If you could make any change you want in your current situation or%0aassignment what would it be?%0a* What setting would be most inspirational for you if you were asked%0afor a really creative idea?%0a* How would you remove worry and fear of failure from your mind and%0areplace them with what William Miller calls "a flash of brillilance"?%0a* How can you stretch your mind without leaving your brain hanging in%0along gray loops?%0a* What gift would you seek from seven specific geniuses to enhance%0ayour own creative powers?%0a%0aFrom: Bob Phillips %3cexpsoln@NOSPAMpreferred.com>%0aHere are some questions that have proved useful to me in the past (my%0acareer was in Industrial Innovation).%0a1 How else might we solve this problem or take advantage of this%0aopportunity?%0a2 How else might we define the problem/opportunity we face?%0a3 How can we polish this "diamond in the rough"?%0a4 How would you describe the feelings of "aha" that you have%0aexperienced?%0a5 Who else can help us with our problem?%0a%0aFrom: Dale M. Parish %3cIE_DMP@nospamHAL.LAMAR.EDU>%0a1 What is it that '''I''' (manager) do that I can stop doing that would%0ahelp you feel less restricted.%0a2 What is it about the work environment here that you believe keeps%0apeople from offering their suggestions.%0a3 What can we do together to take the limits away for solving%0athis/these problem(s).%0a4 Whom in this department do you feel is the least receptive to change%0athat could be moved to a position where they could be happy in doing%0anon-creative work?%0a5 What structure can I create as department manager to make the others%0ain this department really believe that their most outlandish suggestions%0awould be given a fair shake?%0a%0a----%0a%0aInnovation Network	http://www.thinksmart.com%0a451 E. 58th Ave., #4625, Box 468 Phone: 303-308-1088%0aDenver, CO  80216 FAX:	303-295-6108%0astaff@NOSPAMthinksmart.com%0a(:sourceend:)%0a%0a%0a%0a>>comment%3c%3c%0aKeep metadata at end of page%0a%0aSummary:An email conversation where people submitted their questions to stimulate creativity%0aParent:Consulting(.HomePage)%0aIncludeMe:[[Consulting.HomePage]]%0aCategories:[[!Articles]]%0aTags: questions, creativity, Wake-up Brain%0a(:tags-hide questions, creativity, Wake-up Brain :)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a

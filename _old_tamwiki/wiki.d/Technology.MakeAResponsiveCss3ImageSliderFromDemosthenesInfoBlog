Make a Responsive CSS3 Image Slider%0a%0aLink: [[http://demosthenes.info:80/blog/627/Make-A-Responsive-CSS3-Image-Slider | Make A Responsive CSS3 Image Slider]]%0a%0a>>quote%3c%3c%0a%0aPreviously, I&rsquo;ve demonstrated how to make a [[http://demosthenes.info:80/blog/495/Make-A-CSS3-Animated-Image-Slider | fixed-width CSS image slider]]. Increasingly, web developers desire solutions that not only scale across viewport sizes, but perform well on [[http://demosthenes.info:80/blog/mobile | mobile]] devices. The responsive solution detailed here is particularly well-suited to those goals, as it avoids JavaScript entirely, running purely in CSS3 (and thus '''faster, smoother, and with less overhead''').%0a%0aThe idea is very similar to the previous example: an &ldquo;imagestrip&rdquo; containing all the photographs of our slider moving inside a window element which works to restrict the visibility of elements outside it. For this example, you&rsquo;ll need four images, although in practice you could make a strip with as many images as you wished. The sole condition is that all the images must be exactly the same size.%0a%0a!! Create A Responsive Frame%0a%0aFirst, we need to make the window element responsive. We do this by inserting a copy of one of the images from the slider inside the element, and setting an appropriate inline style:%0a%0a(:source lang=html5 linenum:)%0a%3cdiv id="window">%0a   %3cimg src="austin-fireworks.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 100%25;">%0a%3c/div>%0a(:sourceend:)%0a%0a(I&rsquo;m leaving the @@alt@@ attribute blank to save on space; in production, it would be filled out appropriately for [[http://demosthenes.info:80/blog/accessibility | accessibility]] and [[http://demosthenes.info:80/blog/SEO | SEO]] purposes).%0a%0aThe window is given a @@max-width@@ that corresponds to the natural width of the image (1000px, in the case of the example), as we don&rsquo;t want to show more of the imagestrip than one image. All images are floated left to remove space at the bottom of their containers.%0a%0a(:source lang=css linenum:)%0adiv#window {%0a   max-width: 1000px;%0a   position: relative;%0a   overflow: hidden;%0a}%0aimg { float: left; }%0a(:sourceend:)%0a%0a%0a!! Design a Strip of Images%0a%0aWith the placeholder image added, we can create the interior imagestrip. This will immediately obscure the placeholder, but that&rsquo;s okay: '''the sole purpose of the placeholder is to make the window responsive'''; it doesn&rsquo;t need to be visible.%0a%0aOur HTML becomes:%0a%0a(:source lang=html5 linenum:)%0a%3cdiv id="window">%0a   %3cimg src="austin-fireworks.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 100%25;">%0a   %3cfigure id="imagestrip">%0a      %3cimg src="austin-fireworks.jpg" alt="">%0a      %3cimg src="taj-mahal.jpg" alt="">%0a      %3cimg src="ibiza.jpg" alt="">%0a      %3cimg src="ankor-wat.jpg" alt="">%0a      %3cimg src="austin-fireworks.jpg" alt="">%0a   %3c/figure>%0a%3c/div>%0a(:sourceend:)%0a%0aNote that the same image is placed at the start and end of the strip, allowing the animation to repeat in a smooth loop.%0a%0aIn our CSS, the width of @@#window@@ is described as a percentage multiplier of the @@div@@ that contains it. That is, if imagestrip contains five images, and the @@div@@ shows just one, the @@figure@@ is 5x wider, or 500%25 the width of the container @@div@@.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s also positioned absolutely, enabling us to describe its position relative to its container.%0a%0a(:source lang=css linenum:)%0afigure#imagestrip {%0a   position: absolute;%0a   width: 500%25;%0a   margin: 0;%0a   top: 0;%0a   left: 0;%0a}%0a(:sourceend:)%0a%0a%0aWe have to evenly divide the photographs inside the imagestrip. We could use a layout such as flexbox to do so, but the math in standard CSS is very simple. If we consider the @@figure@@ element to be 100%25 wide, each image needs to take up 1/5 of the horizontal space:%0a%0a     100%25 &divide; 5 = 20%25%0a%0aWhich leads to the following CSS declaration:%0a%0a(:source lang=css:)%0afigure#imagestrip img {%0a   float: left;%0a   width: 20%25;%0a}%0a(:sourceend:)%0a%0a%0a!! Animate The Strip%0a%0aFinally, we have to get the imagestrip moving from left to right. If the containing @@div@@ is 100%25 wide, then each movement of the imagestrip to the left will be measured in increments of that distance:%0a%0a(:source lang=css linenum:)%0a@keyframes slidy {%0a   20%25 { left: 0%25; }%0a   25%25 { left: -100%25; }%0a   45%25 { left: -100%25; }%0a   50%25 { left: -200%25; }%0a   70%25 { left: -200%25; }%0a   75%25 { left: -300%25; }%0a   95%25 { left: -300%25; }%0a   100%25 { left: -400%25; }&nbsp;%0a}%0a(:sourceend:)%0a%0aEach image in the slider will stay framed in the @@div@@ for 20%25 of the total length of the animation, and move for 5%25.%0a%0aWe have to call on the animation to get things started:%0a%0a(:source lang=css linenum:)%0afigure { %0a   position: absolute;%0a   width: 500%25;%0a   margin: 0;%0a   top: 0;%0a   left: 0;%0a   animation: 30s slidy ease-in-out infinite;%0a}%0a(:sourceend:)%0a%0aAs you can see, making a responsive slider is in many ways easier than making a fixed one.%0a%0a'-(Both the keyframes and animation code is shown without [[http://demosthenes.info:80/blog/217/CSS3-Vendor-Prefixes | vendor prefixes]] in order to save on space &ndash; you can resize your browser window to see the effect on the slider.

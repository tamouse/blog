Installing this was%0apretty straight-forward, with a couple of caveats.%0a%0a# you need to make sure the required rubygems are installed. One in%0a  particular, fileutils, requires that imagemagick libmagick9-dev%0a  development package  be installed. This was somewhat of a surprise,%0a  but the fileutils package requires the rmagick package, which in%0a  turn relied on the Magic-config script, which only comes from the%0a  aforementioned library.%0a%0a# I was running on ubuntu GNU/Linux. The ruby script assumes you are%0a  running on a Mac, where the plutil program has different switches%0a  that the one available on linux (you do need to install the plutil%0a  programs on linux). To make it work under linux, change the line in%0a  the textmate_import.rb file from @@-convert@@ to @@-i@@. The change%0a  is shown in the following diff output:%0a%0a(:source -getcode:)%0a331c331%0a%3c       if (system "plutil -convert xml1 #{xml_or_binary.shellescape} -o /tmp/textmate_import.tmpxml")%0a---%0a>       if (system "plutil -i #{xml_or_binary.shellescape} -o /tmp/textmate_import.tmpxml")%0a(:sourceend:)%0a%0a-> As you can see, the change is quite simple, and then the script%0a   works as expected.%0a%0aIt wasn't clear from the beginning how to work the script. As there's%0ano documentation or README file, here are a few things I've gleaned%0afrom using it:%0a%0a* Use the -d, -o and -g tags:%0a(:source lang=bash:)%0atextmate_import.rb -b path/to/snippets/in/bundle -o path/to/yasnippet/snippets/mode -g bundle/info.plist%0a(:sourceend:)%0a%0a!!Getting snippets%0a%0aThe coolest thing is that textmate bundles are available on github at%0a[[https://github.com/textmate/]]. You simply clone the bundle from the%0agit repo for that bundle:%0a(:source lang=bash:)%0agit clone https://github.com/textmate/php.tmbundle.git php.tmbundle%0a(:sourceend:)%0awill snag that bundle so you have a local copy of it.

You should go through%0athe snippet files to clean up various things. Notably, in yasnippet,%0athe $0 tab stop can't take any modifiers or text, so it has to sit%0abare in the snippet.%0a%0aAlso, some textmate snippets use special textmate variables which%0ayou'll have to go through and clean up.%0a%0a!!Key Bindings%0a%0aI also added bindings for many of the snippets I use that might be%0aused to modify selected text rather than simply be typed in and%0aexpanded.

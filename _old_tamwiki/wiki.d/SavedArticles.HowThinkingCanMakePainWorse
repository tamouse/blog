We can however learn not to make it worse by adding to it the suffering caused by negative thinking, such as ''{$LQuote}I can't stand this{$RQuote}''. Thoughts like this are unnecessary and we can let them go.%0a%0a!!!A student asks:%0a%0aI experience a great deal of physical pain and struggle to understand%0awhy. I can only come up with the fact that everyone suffers. Some people%0atalk as if I could be rid of my pain if only I could get my mind set%0aright, which doesn't help me. I try to stay in the moment and enjoy each%0amoment, but would be grateful for some advice.%0a%0a!!!Lama Shenpen replies:%0a%0aAs far as making sense of the pain is concerned I think the only thing%0ato think is that pain is the nature of samsara. It is the first Noble%0aTruth the Buddha taught because he was not out to deceive us. He%0aelevated it to a Noble Truth because until we truly understand the depth%0aand true nature of suffering there is no final Liberation from it. It is%0agoing to be with us for the whole of the path whether we want it or not.%0a%0aWe all have to suffer and we none of us know when we will have to bear%0awhat and for how long. Our situation can change so drastically and so%0asuddenly and some forms of suffering go on and on. When we contemplate%0ahow this is true for every being there is everywhere we start to yearn%0afor what goes beyond samsara &mdash; a state of mind in which we can face any%0asituation however intense with equanimity. This is the highest spiritual%0aaccomplishment, its called Enlightenment. We can keep aspiring for it%0aand for the conditions that will bring it about for ourselves and all%0abeings. Such an aspiration is not just wishful thinking. Such aspiration%0ais the path itself. The constant aspiration is the path.%0a%0aEnlightenment itself is not conditioned but we are. We are so easily%0adistracted and discouraged from even aspiring to realise what lies%0abeyond all suffering. But the pain doesn't go away. Even if it goes%0atemporarily there is no guarantee that it won't come back until we are%0aEnlightened. That is when we realise the true nature of reality which is%0aour own being. It is a long path and we have to suffer a lot on the way.%0a%0aIf you can relate to your present suffering with some kind of sense of%0ait being your path, then the suffering itself becomes your practice.%0aJust being able to let go of negative thinking and struggling with the%0apain and being more simple about it, that already means you are making%0athe suffering into the path. Gradually as you learn to not add to your%0asuffering by negative thinking, you will find the pain itself has a kind%0aof quality of awareness to it that can sometimes feel strangely ok...%0aand that it is the thinking of ''{$LQuote}I cannot stand this{$RQuote}'' that is the real%0asuffering &mdash; the struggle... the remembering how long it has gone on and%0adreading how long it might last... this is thinking and adding something%0aheavy and stressful to the original sensation of pain. This can be%0areduced by noticing it is not the pain itself but an added suffering. It%0ais possible to notice it is thinking and has no more status than any%0aother thought. Such thinking can be reduced tremendously by simply not%0afeeding it with the belief that it is necessary. Such thinking is not%0anecessary... it is just like any other thought that you let go of all%0athe time. It is possible to let it go.%0a%0aThat is a huge thing to learn. It is massive. But even to learn it a%0atiny bit brings relief. So that is all I can suggest really. Pain such%0aas yours is a harsh teacher but in the end may be kind. The rest of us%0aare relatively heedless because we are not suffering that much right%0anow. You have a goad forcing you to search deeply and to long for%0aEnlightenment with a fierce intensity &mdash; if you can extend this to all%0aother beings who are suffering with you... and we all will be sooner or%0alater... then you are turning your suffering into your spiritual path.%0aIt is not meaningless.%0a%0aI don't know if this helps. I hope it does.%0a%0a----%0a%0aThe Four Noble Truths: The basic teaching of the Buddha:%0a# suffering,%0a# the causes of suffering,%0a# cessation of suffering,%0a# the path out of suffering%0a%0a:Samsara:The endless wandering round in an endless succession of lives each characterised by suffering.

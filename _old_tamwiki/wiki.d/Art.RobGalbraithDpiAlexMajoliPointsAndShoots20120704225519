He was in Congo for two weeks and Iraq for%0aalmost two months. In those two places he was shooting war.Majoli's%0aimages for all three stories drew rave notices, and they earned him%0asome of photojournalism's most prestigious awards in 2004, including%0athe U.S. National Press Photographers Association's Best of%0aPhotojournalism%0a[[http://www.nppa.org/competitions/best_of_still_photojournalism/2004/winners/still/index.cfm?category=MPY&place=1st&image=1| Magazine Photographer of the Year]] Award and the U.S. Overseas%0aPress Club's Feature Photography Award.It would seem reasonable to%0aguess that all that award-winning work in remote and frequently%0adangerous places must have been shot with big, fast, bulletproof pro%0aSLR cameras. But in fact, Majoli shot every frame with Olympus C-5050%0adigital point-and-shoots -- the same camera your snap happy Uncle%0aMaury takes to Disney World.More recently he's been using the%0a[[http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/cpg_product_lobbypage.asp?l=1&p=16&bc=2&product=961| Olympus C-8080]], along with his older C-5050 and C-5060 cameras,%0afor many of his assignments, including shooting in Israel for ''Vanity%0aFair'' and the U.S. presidential elections for ''Newsweek''.%0a%0a%25width=90pct%25http://www.robgalbraith.com:80/data/1/rec_imgs/741_majoli_02.jpg|(2003) Street kids begging&nbsp;in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo. (Photo by Alex Majoli/Magnum Photos)%0a%0aMajoli acknowledges that%0amost of his photojournalist colleagues think he's crazy, but he's been%0ashooting with digital point-and-shoots for three years, developing%0atechniques to deal with their shortcomings and exploring their unique%0astrengths, which still intrigue him. "I was interested in finding a%0acamera that gives me some new way to approach the subject," says the%0a34-year-old Majoli, who was born in Italy and now splits his time%0abetween there and New York City. His English is clear and delivered%0awith a distinct Italian accent. "This camera, you can shoot in a%0adifferent way."Majoli, who has been a professional photojournalist%0asince 1990, first discovered the new way that digital point-and-shoots%0amake possible when he was working on the book project%0a[[http://www.ditlafrica.com/ | A Day in the Life of Africa]] in early%0a2002. Olympus was one of the sponsors of that particular Day in the%0aLife effort, and the company gave Majoli an E-20 digital SLR and a%0a4-megapixel C-4040 digital point-and-shoot to use while shooting for%0athe book."I found the C-4040 amazing," the photographer says. "So%0asmall. And it made a great file. So this was the big thing, the size%0aof the camera and the quality of the file."But other qualities that%0adifferentiate the various point-and-shoot models he's used from their%0aSLR cousins also fit well with his shooting preferences, Majoli%0asays. "The screen that pulls out [and] shooting really silent. Digital%0acameras are great in the night. Depth of field is fantastic;%0aeverything is sharp. This was another thing that was really%0ainteresting. It's like on video, everything possible is sharp. It's a%0anew way to see the world."%0a%0a%25width=90pct%25http://www.robgalbraith.com:80/data/1/rec_imgs/742_majoli_05.jpg|(April 2003) U.S. troops survey burning oil fields in southwest Iraq. (Photo by Alex Majoli/Magnum Photos)%0a%0aThe C-4040 was not%0aactually Majoli's first digital camera, and his previous experience%0ahad been with a camera more likely to be associated with a%0aprofessional photojournalist, namely the Canon EOS D30. He used one%0awhile covering the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, adopting it because%0aof the need to meet short deadlines.But it's perhaps easy to%0aunderstand why Majoli wasn't particularly enamored of that camera when%0ayou learn that -- prior to his fateful meeting with the C-4040 -- the%0aphotographer shot all of his previous work with Leica rangefinders and%0athe very compact 28mm and 35mm Leica M-system lenses.On a typical%0ashooting day now, Majoli carries four Olympus point-and-shoots and not%0aa single digital SLR or film rangefinder. In 2003, he began using the%0aC-4040's successors, the 5-megapixel C-5050 and C-5060 cameras, and in%0athe summer of 2004 he added a few of the 8-megapixel C-8080 cameras to%0ahis gear bag.He carries six or seven 512MB Lexar CompactFlash cards%0abut no shooting accessories -- not even an external flash. When he%0agears up for a long assignment he'll pack a couple of extra cameras --%0ai.e. six total -- so that he can weather any equipment failures.

text=[[#excerpt]]%0aTo achieve better modularization, the functions of fetching, updating, creating, and displaying can be put into `ColdFusion templates (or eventually into custom tags).  To make this work well, some contraints on the name conventions of fields in the data base itself should be followed, so that regular expressions can evaluate simply into the required table and field names.%0a[[#excerptend]]%0a%0aFor example, the following two table definitions show how one might do this:%0a%0a>>width=50pct margin="0px auto"%3c%3c%0a|| border=1 cellspacing=3px cellpadding=3px%0a||!

Similar field names should be determined as well.  Frequently this may not be possible until the data base is designed, which means the design should be fairly complete before beginning to code.  This means that EVO approach may not work well in this environment.  Compensating factors are to design enough of the data base to start with, and establish the rules for naming, so subsequent additions follow the same rules.%0a%0a(:Summary:An idea to make `ColdFusion programs more maintainable:)%0a(:Parent:(Technology.)ColdFusion:)%0a(:IncludeMe:[[(Technology.)ColdFusion]]:)%0a(:Categories:[[!Articles]],[[!BestPractices]]:)%0a(:Tags: cold fusion, modularity:)%0a(:tags-hide cold fusion, modularity :)%0a%0a%0a

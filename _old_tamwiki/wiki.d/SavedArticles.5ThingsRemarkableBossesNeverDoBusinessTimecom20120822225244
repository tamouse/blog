A number of people emailed and asked, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great list, but flip it around: What things should I&nbsp;''not''&nbsp;do?&rdquo;%0a%0aGlad you asked.%0a%0aAs a leader what you don&rsquo;t do can sometimes make as much or even more impact than what you do. Here are five things remarkable bosses&nbsp;''never''&nbsp;do:%0a%0a!! Say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been meaning to apologize for a while&hellip;&rdquo;%0a%0aYou should never need to apologize for not having apologized sooner.%0a%0aWhen you mess up, &lsquo;fess up. Right away. You certainly want employees to immediately tell you when they make a mistake, so model the same behavior.%0a%0aIf love means never having to say you&rsquo;re sorry, leadership means always having to say you&rsquo;re sorry.%0a%0a!! Deliver annual performance reviews.%0a%0aAnnual or semi-annual performance appraisals are largely a waste of time.%0a%0aYears ago my review was late so I mentioned it to my boss. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get to it&hellip; but you should know you won&rsquo;t hear anything new. You&rsquo;ve already heard everything I will say, good or bad. If anything on your review comes as a surprise to you I haven&rsquo;t done my job.&rdquo;%0a%0aHe was right. The best feedback isn&rsquo;t scheduled. The&nbsp;[[http://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/the-9-elements-of-highly-effective-employee-praise.html | best feedback]]&nbsp;happens on the spot when it makes the most impact, either as praise and encouragement or as training and suggestions for improvement. Waiting for a scheduled review is the lazy way out.%0a%0aYour job is to coach and mentor and develop&ndash;every day.%0a%0a!! Hold formal meetings to solicit ideas.%0a%0aMany companies hold brainstorming sessions to solicit ideas for improvement, especially when times get tough.%0a%0aSounds great; after all you&rsquo;re &ldquo;engaging employees&rdquo; and &ldquo;valuing their contributions,&rdquo; right? But you don&rsquo;t need a meeting to get input. When employees know you listen they bring ideas to you.%0a%0aAnd if you must ask, the better way to ask for ideas is to talk to people individually and to be more specific. Say, &ldquo;I wish we could find a way to get orders through our system faster. What would you change if you were me?&rdquo;%0a%0aTrust me: Employees picture themselves doing your job&ndash;and doing your job better than you&ndash;all the time. They have ideas. Sometimes they have great ideas. Be open, act on good ideas, explain why less than good ideas aren&rsquo;t feasible&hellip; and you&rsquo;ll get all the input you can handle without a formal meeting.%0a%0a!! Create development plans.%0a%0aFormal development plans are, like annual performance reviews, largely a corporate construct. You should know what each of your employees hopes to achieve: Skills and experience they want to gain, career paths they hope to take, etc.%0a%0aSo talk about it&ndash;informally. Then assign projects that fit. Provide training that fits. Create opportunities that fit.%0a%0aThen give feedback on the spot. &ldquo;Develop&rdquo; is a verb. To develop requires action. &ldquo;Development&rdquo; is a noun that sits in a file cabinet.%0a%0a!! Call in favors.%0a%0aI know lots of bosses who play the guilt game, like saying, &ldquo;Mark, I was really flexible with your schedule while your son was sick&hellip; now I really need you to come through for me and work this weekend.&rdquo;%0a%0aGenerosity should always be a one-way street. Be flexible when being flexible is the right thing to do. Be accommodating when being accommodating is the right thing to do.%0a%0aNever lend money to friends unless you don&rsquo;t care if you are repaid, and never do &ldquo;favors&rdquo; for employees in anticipation of return.%0a%0aRemarkable leaders only give. They never take.%0a%0a''Jeff Haden&nbsp;learned much of what he knows about business and technology as he worked his way up in the manufacturing industry. Everything else he picks up from&nbsp;[[http://www.blackbirdinc.com/ | ghostwriting books]]&nbsp;for some of the smartest leaders he knows in business.&nbsp;[[http://www.twitter.com/jeff_haden | @jeff_haden]]''%0a%0a(:linkwikiwords:)%0a

A number of people emailed and asked, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great list, but flip it around: What things should I&nbsp;''not''&nbsp;do?&rdquo;%0a%3c %0a%3c Glad you asked.%0a%3c %0a%3c As a leader what you don&rsquo;t do can sometimes make as much or even more impact than what you do. Here are five things remarkable bosses&nbsp;''never''&nbsp;do:%0a%3c %0a%3c !!! Say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been meaning to apologize for a while&hellip;&rdquo;%0a%3c %0a%3c You should never need to apologize for not having apologized sooner.%0a%3c %0a%3c When you mess up, &lsquo;fess up. Right away. You certainly want employees to immediately tell you when they make a mistake, so model the same behavior.%0a%3c %0a%3c If love means never having to say you&rsquo;re sorry, leadership means always having to say you&rsquo;re sorry.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!! Deliver annual performance reviews.%0a%3c %0a%3c Annual or semi-annual performance appraisals are largely a waste of time.%0a%3c %0a%3c Years ago my review was late so I mentioned it to my boss. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get to it&hellip; but you should know you won&rsquo;t hear anything new. You&rsquo;ve already heard everything I will say, good or bad. If anything on your review comes as a surprise to you I haven&rsquo;t done my job.&rdquo;%0a%3c %0a%3c He was right. The best feedback isn&rsquo;t scheduled. The&nbsp;[[http://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/the-9-elements-of-highly-effective-employee-praise.html | best feedback]]&nbsp;happens on the spot when it makes the most impact, either as praise and encouragement or as training and suggestions for improvement. Waiting for a scheduled review is the lazy way out.%0a%3c %0a%3c Your job is to coach and mentor and develop&ndash;every day.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!! Hold formal meetings to solicit ideas.%0a%3c %0a%3c Many companies hold brainstorming sessions to solicit ideas for improvement, especially when times get tough.%0a%3c %0a%3c Sounds great; after all you&rsquo;re &ldquo;engaging employees&rdquo; and &ldquo;valuing their contributions,&rdquo; right? But you don&rsquo;t need a meeting to get input. When employees know you listen they bring ideas to you.%0a%3c %0a%3c And if you must ask, the better way to ask for ideas is to talk to people individually and to be more specific. Say, &ldquo;I wish we could find a way to get orders through our system faster. What would you change if you were me?&rdquo;%0a%3c %0a%3c Trust me: Employees picture themselves doing your job&ndash;and doing your job better than you&ndash;all the time. They have ideas. Sometimes they have great ideas. Be open, act on good ideas, explain why less than good ideas aren&rsquo;t feasible&hellip; and you&rsquo;ll get all the input you can handle without a formal meeting.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!! Create development plans.%0a%3c %0a%3c Formal development plans are, like annual performance reviews, largely a corporate construct. You should know what each of your employees hopes to achieve: Skills and experience they want to gain, career paths they hope to take, etc.%0a%3c %0a%3c So talk about it&ndash;informally. Then assign projects that fit. Provide training that fits. Create opportunities that fit.%0a%3c %0a%3c Then give feedback on the spot. &ldquo;Develop&rdquo; is a verb. To develop requires action. &ldquo;Development&rdquo; is a noun that sits in a file cabinet.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!! Call in favors.%0a%3c %0a%3c I know lots of bosses who play the guilt game, like saying, &ldquo;Mark, I was really flexible with your schedule while your son was sick&hellip; now I really need you to come through for me and work this weekend.&rdquo;%0a%3c %0a%3c Generosity should always be a one-way street. Be flexible when being flexible is the right thing to do. Be accommodating when being accommodating is the right thing to do.%0a%3c %0a%3c Never lend money to friends unless you don&rsquo;t care if you are repaid, and never do &ldquo;favors&rdquo; for employees in anticipation of return.%0a%3c %0a%3c Remarkable leaders only give. They never take.%0a%3c %0a%3c ''Jeff Haden&nbsp;learned much of what he knows about business and technology as he worked his way up in the manufacturing industry.

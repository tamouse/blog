They force the average user to write them down, or worse, type them into a text file in order to remember them. Good to enforce some minimal characteristics (e.g. at least one number or capital) and do some basic checks (minimum length, must differ from user ID, at least a few different characters), but you want something your users can remember.%0a%0a* Hash the passwords with a secure algorithm (see SHA-1), as there's no reason to retrieve them. When a user logs in, hash the input and compare it to the stored hash.%0a%0a* Email address as user ID is reasonable, as your users will probably remember it (especially if your login prompt says "Enter email address"). No need for users to update it if their address changes unless you use it for something else (such as password reset). Better to have a separate field for password recovery information.%0a%0a* Encrypt the user `IDs, since you will need to retrieve them. Storing them unencrypted tells an attacker which accounts are valid, eliminating half the break-in battle.%0a%0a* '''Never''' send a forgotten password to anyone. (This is easier to abide by if you hash the passwords, as you will no longer have the plaintext.) A reasonable practice is to email a one-time link to the user's pre-registered email address, directing the user to a "reset password" page. Depending on the required level of security, you might want to ask for some sort of identifying information, then ask them to enter a new password.%0a%0aAs always, tailor your implementation to fit the required security level: what's at stake if the data is compromised, and to what lengths should you and your users go to protect it? When in doubt, follow the model of an online banking system. In general, where money is involved, a lot of research has been invested in best practices for security.%0a	%0aedited Nov 7 '08 at 0:33%0a%0a	%0aanswered Nov 6 '08 at 22:08%0aAdam Liss%0a%0a----%0a	%0a"When in doubt, follow the model of an online banking system." -- Yes and no, cf thedailywtf.com.

Mark Hammond contributed the original idea, and other members of the SIG chimed in to add support for their favorite browser features. After debate which ranged far afield from the original idea, compromises were reached which allow XBEL to be a useful language for describing bookmark data for a range of browsers, including the major browsers and a number of less widely used browsers.%0a  %0a%0a%0a(:linebreaks:)%0aExport Safari bookmarks to XBEL%0aFri, Apr 9 '04 at 10:22AM ï from: Anonymous%0a(:nolinebreaks:)%0a%0aFor accessing my Safari Bookmarks while on the road, I have a little web application running which makes use of the ever more popular XBEL format.

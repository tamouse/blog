I've never kept a journal,%0aor pondered the meaning of life or even been depressed. Once, when my%0acollege girlfriend dumped me, I was really sad, but even then I was more%0aexcited about the life experience of feeling depressed than actually%0adepressed, which kind of ruined the whole thing. When people talk about%0afinding out who they are, I just look at them blankly, since that's not%0asomething I ever think about. I know who I am: I'm a guy who enjoys food,%0atelevision and sex. The only reason I ever wanted depth was that women%0afind it attractive. If depth also got you food and TV, I'd brood in a way%0athat would make Johnny Depp look like Richard Simmons by comparison.%0a%0aI'm so shallow I wouldn't even by aware of my lack of depth if it%0aweren't for the fact that my mother is a therapist and points it out to%0ame.  In fact, the only time I've been to a therapy session was when she%0abrought me with her and my dad to talk about how their divorce was%0ahurting my sister; when I got there, the shrink pulled out a column my%0amom had planted there that I had written for my college paper about being%0aunable to feel anything, which deeply concerned my mom.  A column that%0amay or many not have lines I'm reusing right now.%0a%0aPersonally, I found it hard to believe I'm the one with the problems%0awhen my mother, who was going through a divorce, was making time to%0aCandid Camera me.  Nevertheless, in the interest of self-exploration and%0ato avoid writing an actual science story for this mental-health issue, I%0adecided to be analyzed by Dr. Phil.  Searching for problems to work on, I%0aconsidered talking to him about not having got a haircut for 11 months in%0aan effort to disguise the fact that I'm going bald.  But I figured Dr.%0aPhil might not be the best person to bring that up with.%0a%0aSo I called my mom, who is a big Dr. Phil fan, and asked her what's%0awrong with me.  "Do you have to come up with just one issue?" she asked. %0aI was already regretting this phone call.  "One of the issues is your%0aavoidance of conflict.  You refuse to fight.  You walk away.  It would be%0ainteresting to see where that came from," she said.  I suggested that it%0apossibly came from having a therapist mom.  Then she said something else%0athat I said I agreed with, but sort of messed since I was typing an%0ae-mail.  I can safely guess it involved the words "sharing," "intimacy"%0aand "relationship."	%0a%0aDr. Phil, however, thought my mom was completely wrong.  "I've been%0amarried coming up on 28 years now, and Robin and I never fight.  I%0aabsolutely hate conflict and confrontation," he said.  "The problem is,%0awhen you don't argue, you miss makeup sex.  And that's absolutely the%0abest sex in the whole world."  Then I got kind of grossed out thinking%0aabout my mom.  "Also, right before Valentine's Day or Christmas, a good%0afight can save you several hundred dollars," Dr. Phil continued.  Good%0aadvice.  You don't get to put "Dr." in front of your name for nothing.%0a%0aDr. Phil also thought my mom was wrong about the way I express myself%0awhen I'm upset: I kind of mope and wait for people to notice instead of%0ajust telling them how I feel with words like "sharing," "intimacy,"%0a"relationship," and "make-up sex."  Further refuting my mom, Dr. Phil%0asaid, "One of my favorite songs is by Ronan Keating.  He says, 'You say%0athe most when you say nothing at all.'"  I wish Dr. Phil had been around%0ato argue with my mom for me when I was 16.%0a%0a%0aAlso, Dr. Phil said my avoidance of conflict was clearly not keeping me%0afrom expressing my needs and innermost thoughts.  "I think your columns%0aare amazingly intimate.  You tell people what you are feeling and%0athinking and experiencing.	It's high disclosure."  He also said he was%0a"a fan" and that I "have a really good sense of humor."	That makes it%0aDr. Phil 3, Mom 0.%0a%0aWith time still left on my 50 minutes, I asked the doctor if I'm too%0anarcissistic.  "Seems to me it's working for you pretty well," he said. %0a"Don't fix what ain't broke."  Finally, I posed my major self-improvement%0adilemma to him.  "I think maybe I watch too much porn," I said, to which%0aDr. Phil replied, "Is it making you tired?"  If being unable to stay%0aawake is the definition of a problem, then perhaps I am actually not%0awatching enough.%0a%0aA new convert to therapy, not because I wound up with any insights, but%0abecause it encouraged more porn viewing, I thanked Dr. Phil.  Then I%0acalled my mom to ask her how it felt to have lost, big time.%0a%0a"I'm very happy that Dr. Phil thinks you're so psychologically healthy. %0aThat means I did a great job," she said.%0a%0aTherapists are good.  Especially if you knew what she made me take out of this column.%0a%0a

text=(From mehmet)%0a%0a%0a!!Testing In A Service Oriented World%0a%0a''Abstract:'' Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is the latest attempt to better link the business with technology. Testing a SOA applications become more and more complex, as it should be continuous, not just in development and integration, but in deployment, because an SOA by nature is never a static application. Even if each service in a SOA application is tested thoroughly and carefully the quality of the final application may suffer because testing is not enough after the integration of the services. This article presents the challenges and problems that test teams experience when testing SOA applications. It also summarizes how the testing of SOA is carried out now and gives some ideas on further improvements.

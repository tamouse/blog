Unclutterer recommends you stop thinking of your inbox as a filing cabinet and get rid of old emails completely.%0a%0aUnclutterer suggestss a simple four step process for clearing out your inbox:%0a%0a%0a* Decide what each message is.%0a* Decide what must be done.%0a* Do what must be done.%0a* Delete the message (or archive it in a separate folder, if that is what your employer directs).%0a%0aThe point is that you delete old messages that you don't need to reference at some point instead of letting them pile up and distract you when you're looking for something important.

That is until my introduction to the landscape photography of Jeremy Davies. Jeremy is one of the many fantastic photographers that work with us here at myPhotopipe, and his work brings depth and visual artistry to a landscape just as vibrant as his approach and technique. Jeremy has a way of interpreting what he sees and feels in the world around him into a tangible manifestation the rest of us can admire from  a distance that's oftentimes otherworldly, yet connect with personally.%0a%0aIntroducing you to the array of chroma Utah's eclectic landscapes has to offer seems like a natural progression in this budding love affair of colorful photography we're sharing. Allowing yourself to get lost in the escapism Jeremy's sensible, yet discerning eye offers will open you up to a plethora of possible color combinations when examining the color palettes of his photography.%0a(:linkwikiwords:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a!!!

Dutton%0aApril 25, 2012%0a%0aI wanted to be a writer long before I wanted to write about myself. I&rsquo;ve been an enthusiastic reader since childhood, and at ten years old genre lines were very simple. Nonfiction meant reading biographies, or history books, or newspaper articles; fiction meant devouring the adventures of the Hardy Boys, or Sherlock Holmes, or Agatha Christie&rsquo;s Hercule Poirot. The latter was fun, and the former was not, and it&rsquo;s no surprise that my earliest attempts at literary greatness mirrored what I enjoyed reading. I don&rsquo;t remember being motivated by childhood dreams of fame and fortune. In the beginning I hoped I could get lost in my own writing as easily as that of others. Reading meant entering worlds I loved, and writing meant creating those worlds.%0a%0aThe worlds of my imagination needed people to live in them, of course, and a good deal of thought went into just how much of myself would find its way into my heroes. I could give one my first name, or maybe another would have blond hair and blue eyes. I could get my characters to act the way I wished I would act in dangerous situations, but there the similarities stopped. A hero had to be formed from just enough reality to feed my fantasy, and just enough fiction to transcend my limitations. My heroes were not to be short, or scared. They were not to be weak, and they certainly were not going to be disabled.%0a%0aI don&rsquo;t think I made a conscious effort to keep my cerebral palsy out of my writing. It would be more accurate to say that I didn&rsquo;t see the point of including it. Why dwell on what limited me when a blank page offered the opportunity for so much more? I authored a detective story in elementary school, and in high school I was dabbling in tales of adventure, always with a protagonist who was a perfect, able-bodied version of me, always with a story involving a beautiful girl, some very bad guys and scenes that belonged in an action movie. It wasn&rsquo;t until college that I was properly introduced to the personal essay and the term &ldquo;creative nonfiction,&rdquo; but even as I discovered some skill with the form, there was something preferable to me about the world of make-believe.%0a(:linkwikiwords:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a!!

It tells you how to suture a wound, heal burns, make your own contraception, diagnose tropical skin diseases, and thousands of other do-it-yourself medical procedures you won7t find elsewhere. Originally written (in Spanish) for para-medicals in the developing world, the medical instructions are clear, methodical, reliable, and helpful. Not all the content is emergency care; a lot is basic hygiene and preventative care.%0a%0aThis book is crammed with essential, life-saving knowledge for anyone living or traveling for long periods in undeveloped areas without doctors close by. It can be found in the packs of transcontinental bicyclists, arctic explorers, missionaries and Peace Corp folks. The book is too heavy to lug around in a tourist backpack, but it is also available as a free PDF. But even with access to modern medical facilities, I7ve found this book gives me an abbreviated medical school education. It offers very realistic first aid treatments (more than just bandages), and very easy-to-understand explanations of what doctors see in injuries. It can help you talk to doctors. Finally, when you are done traveling, leave this book behind with someone who can use it.%0a%0aThere is also a companion book, Where There Is No Dentist, equally good.%0a%0a-- KK%0a%0a'''Where There Is No Doctor''',%0aDavid Werner, Jane Maxwell, Carol Thuman.%0a1992, 446 pages.%0a$20,%0aFree PDF: http://hesperian.org/%0a(:linkwikiwords:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a>>comment%3c%3c%0aSummary:This group is a place for me to save websites I come across%0aCategories: [[!GroupHomes]], [[!Collections]], [[!Links]]%0aParent:SavedLinks(.HomePage)%0aincludeme:[[SavedLinks.HomePage]]%0a(:tags-hide links:)%0a>>%3c%3c%0a

Dutton%0a> April 25, 2012%0a> %0a> I wanted to be a writer long before I wanted to write about myself. I&rsquo;ve been an enthusiastic reader since childhood, and at ten years old genre lines were very simple. Nonfiction meant reading biographies, or history books, or newspaper articles; fiction meant devouring the adventures of the Hardy Boys, or Sherlock Holmes, or Agatha Christie&rsquo;s Hercule Poirot. The latter was fun, and the former was not, and it&rsquo;s no surprise that my earliest attempts at literary greatness mirrored what I enjoyed reading. I don&rsquo;t remember being motivated by childhood dreams of fame and fortune. In the beginning I hoped I could get lost in my own writing as easily as that of others. Reading meant entering worlds I loved, and writing meant creating those worlds.%0a> %0a> The worlds of my imagination needed people to live in them, of course, and a good deal of thought went into just how much of myself would find its way into my heroes. I could give one my first name, or maybe another would have blond hair and blue eyes. I could get my characters to act the way I wished I would act in dangerous situations, but there the similarities stopped. A hero had to be formed from just enough reality to feed my fantasy, and just enough fiction to transcend my limitations. My heroes were not to be short, or scared. They were not to be weak, and they certainly were not going to be disabled.%0a> %0a> I don&rsquo;t think I made a conscious effort to keep my cerebral palsy out of my writing. It would be more accurate to say that I didn&rsquo;t see the point of including it. Why dwell on what limited me when a blank page offered the opportunity for so much more? I authored a detective story in elementary school, and in high school I was dabbling in tales of adventure, always with a protagonist who was a perfect, able-bodied version of me, always with a story involving a beautiful girl, some very bad guys and scenes that belonged in an action movie. It wasn&rsquo;t until college that I was properly introduced to the personal essay and the term &ldquo;creative nonfiction,&rdquo; but even as I discovered some skill with the form, there was something preferable to me about the world of make-believe.%0a158,173c158%0a%3c !!!

That is until my introduction to the landscape photography of Jeremy Davies. Jeremy is one of the many fantastic photographers that work with us here at myPhotopipe, and his work brings depth and visual artistry to a landscape just as vibrant as his approach and technique. Jeremy has a way of interpreting what he sees and feels in the world around him into a tangible manifestation the rest of us can admire from  a distance that's oftentimes otherworldly, yet connect with personally.%0a%3c %0a%3c Introducing you to the array of chroma Utah's eclectic landscapes has to offer seems like a natural progression in this budding love affair of colorful photography we're sharing. Allowing yourself to get lost in the escapism Jeremy's sensible, yet discerning eye offers will open you up to a plethora of possible color combinations when examining the color palettes of his photography.%0a%3c (:linkwikiwords:)%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!

It would be more accurate to say that I didn’t see the point of including it. Why dwell on what limited me when a blank page offered the opportunity for so much more? I authored a detective story in elementary school, and in high school I was dabbling in tales of adventure, always with a protagonist who was a perfect, able-bodied version of me, always with a story involving a beautiful girl, some very bad guys and scenes that belonged in an action movie. It wasn’t until college that I was properly introduced to the personal essay and the term “creative nonfiction,” but even as I discovered some skill with the form, there was something preferable to me about the world of make-believe.%0a%3c (:linkwikiwords:)%0a%3c >>%3c%3c%0a%3c (:Tags: journaling, writing, disability:)%0a%3c (:tags-hide journaling, writing, disability:)%0a%3c (:Posted: 2012-5-16 20:00:)%0a%3c %0a

It tells you how to suture a wound, heal burns, make your own contraception, diagnose tropical skin diseases, and thousands of other do-it-yourself medical procedures you won7t find elsewhere. Originally written (in Spanish) for para-medicals in the developing world, the medical instructions are clear, methodical, reliable, and helpful. Not all the content is emergency care; a lot is basic hygiene and preventative care.%0a%3c %0a%3c This book is crammed with essential, life-saving knowledge for anyone living or traveling for long periods in undeveloped areas without doctors close by. It can be found in the packs of transcontinental bicyclists, arctic explorers, missionaries and Peace Corp folks. The book is too heavy to lug around in a tourist backpack, but it is also available as a free PDF. But even with access to modern medical facilities, I7ve found this book gives me an abbreviated medical school education. It offers very realistic first aid treatments (more than just bandages), and very easy-to-understand explanations of what doctors see in injuries. It can help you talk to doctors. Finally, when you are done traveling, leave this book behind with someone who can use it.%0a%3c %0a%3c There is also a companion book, Where There Is No Dentist, equally good.%0a%3c -- KK  %0a%3c Where There Is No Doctor%0a%3c David Werner, Jane Maxwell, Carol Thuman%0a%3c 1992, 446 pages%0a%3c $20%0a%3c Free PDF%0a%3c http://hesperian.org/%0a%3c Available from Amazon%0a%3c (:linkwikiwords:)>>%3c%3c%0a%3c Tags: books, health, medicine, self-help%0a%3c %0a%3c Posted: 2012-3-21 16:34%0a%3c %0a%3c ----%0a%3c %0a

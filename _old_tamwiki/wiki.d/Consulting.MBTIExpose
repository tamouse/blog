Remeber: "The Map is Not the Territory!"%0a[[#excerptend]]%0a%0a!! MBTI Research--The Untold Story%0a%0a%0aEach year, hundreds of people every year invest about a thousand%0adollars and a week's time to learn how to use the Myers-Briggs Type%0aIndicator (MBTI) in training programs. In addition, over a million of%0aother people attend these programs or are subjected to this popular%0apersonality test. While most psychologists consider the MBTI to be%0aunreliable and inconsistent with current scientific theory, the%0ageneral public has no knowledge of its weaknesses. They do not%0aappreciate the dangers of typing, and they do not have access to the%0ascientific literature that has discredited it. You may be interested%0ain finding out about the research that MBTI trainers do not%0amention--indeed, may not even know about. %0a%0a!! Sipps, Gary J., Ralph A. Alexander and Larry Friedt. "Item Analysis of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator." Educational and Psychological Measurement, 45 (1985), 789-796.%0a%0aThe only published item-factor analysis of the MBTI, this study%0aexamined a diverse population of 1,291 subjects. The findings%0arevealed that 41 of the 95 items (43%25) did not correlate significantly%0awith the factors they were supposed to measure. The failure rate was%0aas follows: E-I, 27.3%25; S-N, 57.7%25; T-F, 56.5%25; and J-P, 29.2%25. "This%0araises the question of the appropriateness of the use of these items%0aon the questionnaire," the researchers concluded. %0a%0a!! Carlyn, M. "An Assessment of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator." Journal of Personal Assessment, 41 (1977), 461-473.%0a%0aCarlyn analyzed the independence of the four scales of the MBTI and%0afound that the fourth scale, judgment-perception (J-P), had an%0aunexpectedly high relationship to the sensing-intuition (S-N), with%0acorrelations ranging from .23 to .48 in 11 samples. People who scored%0ahigh in sensing (S) tended to score high in judgment (J); and people%0awho scored high in intuition (N) tended to score high in perception%0a(P). This finding discredits the J-P scale, which is not one of the%0aoriginal Jungian dimensions. Carlyn's findings replicated those of%0aStrickler and Ross (1964). %0a%0a!! Strickler, L. J. and J. A. Ross. "Some Correlates of a Jungian Personality Inventory." Psychological Reports, 14 (April 1964), 623-643.%0a%0aThis study showed unexpectedly high correlations between the S-N scale%0aand the P-J scale.%0a%0a!! McCarley, N. and T. G. Carskadon. "Test-retest Reliabilities of Scales and Subscales of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and of Criteria for Clinical Interpretive Hypotheses Involving Them." Research in Psychological Type, 6 (1983), 24-36.%0a%0aAssigning a type is the primary objective of the MBTI. This study%0aevaluated the stability of the type designation. It noted that the%0atype designation of 53%25 of the subjects changed when retested after%0afive weeks. %0a%0a!! Loomis, Mary and June Singer. "Testing the Bipolar Assumption in Jung's Typology." Journal of Analytical Psychology, 25 (1980), 351-356.%0a%0aTwo Jungian analysts tested the stability of the MBTI type%0adesignations by comparing the types produced by the MBTI, which uses a%0aforced-choice psychometric, and the types produced by a modified MBTI,%0awhich used the same 95 items with scaled responses. If the types%0aproduced by the MBTI are not artificial by-products of the%0aforced-choice questioning method, then changing the method should not%0achange the type designations. In a sample of 79 subjects, 46%25 of the%0atype designations changed when the scaled version was given. They%0aconcluded that the forced-choice questioning method used by the MBTI%0ais not a sufficiently exact measuring device. %0a%0a!! Druckman, Daniel and Robert A. Bjork, eds. The Mind's Eye: Enhancing Human Performance. Washington, DC: National Academy Press, 1991.%0a%0aThe authors summarized studies that evaluated the MBTI and drew%0aseveral conclusions: %0a%0a"The evidence summarized in this section raises questions about the%0avalidity of the MBTI. . . . Unfortunately, neither the gains in%0asensitivity nor the impact of those gains on performance have been%0adocumented by research. Nor has the instrument been validated in a%0along-term study of successful and unsuccessful careers. Lacking such%0aevidence, it is a curiosity why the instrument is used so widely,%0aparticularly in large organizations." (p. 99) %0a%0a"The lack of a supportive research foundation for the MBTI leads the%0acommittee to recommend that the instrument not be used in career%0acounseling programs until its validity is supported by research." (p. 100) %0a%0a"The popularity of this instrument in the absence of proven scientific%0aworth is troublesome." (p. 101) %0a%0a!! Jung, C. G. Psychological Types. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1971 (1921).%0a%0aWhen you read what Carl Jung had to say in Psychological Types, you%0adiscover that it his views are not the same as those of MBTI%0aproponents. %0a%0aIn speaking of the opposing factors of his typology, Jung wrote:%0a"Every human being possesses both mechanisms as an expression of his%0anatural life-rhythm. . . . one mechanism will naturally predominate,%0aand if this condition becomes in any way chronic a type will be%0aproduced. . . . Hence there can never be a pure type in the sense that%0ait possesses only one mechanism with the complete atrophy of the%0aother." pp. 5-6. %0a%0aIn other words, Jung used the concept of "type" to represent an%0aextreme, chronic or pathological condition. He saw the larger%0apopulation of ordinary, healthy people as being outside the boundaries%0aof his typology. He later articulated this view when speaking about%0aextraverts and introverts. "There is, finally, a third group, and here%0ait is hard to say whether the motivation comes chiefly from within or%0awithout. This group is the most numerous and includes the less%0adifferentiated normal man, who is considered normal either because he%0aallows himself no excesses or because he has no need of them. The%0anormal man is by definition, influenced as much from within as from%0awithout." pp. 515-516 (1923). %0a%0aAccording to Jung's thinking, it is erroneous to say that a person is%0aeither an introvert or an extrovert. "By comparing many such cases it%0agradually became clear to me that there must be two fundamentally%0adifferent general attitudes which would divide human beings into two%0agroups--provided the whole of humanity consisted of highly%0adifferentiated individuals. . . . this is obviously not the case." (p. 549 (1936). %0a%0aHe disagreed with the practice of typing people. "The opinion has got%0aabout that my method of treatment consists in fitting patients into%0athis system and giving them corresponding 'advice.' This regrettable%0amisunderstanding completely ignores the fact that this kind of%0aclassification is nothing but a childish parlour game, every bit as%0afutile as the division of mankind into brachycephalics and%0adolichocephalics. My typology is far rather a critical apparatus%0aserving to sort out and organize the welter of empirical material, but%0anot in any sense to stick labels on people." p. xiv (1934).%0a

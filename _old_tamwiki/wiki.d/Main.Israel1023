Recent archiological finds have been made and it has captured the attention of all of Israel. Saphoris is probably the place where Joseph worked, there was lots of building going on.%0a%0aMt. Tabor: significant for the story of Deborrah, and the defeat of the Caananites; unseasonably strong rains mired their war chariots in mud. NT sig.; Supposed spot of Jesu's transfiguration. Basilica on is the Church of the Transfiguration. Large mountain, set apart, fits Mt. Tabor very well. 1600 ft, in the middle of the Gessereal valley.%0a%0a!!11:16 Meggido.%0a%0aGOD! Megiddo! W a exteraordinary site! The tnnel to the well was most fantastic, every bit as exciting as how Michener described it. There is no real indication of how they actually dug the tunnel. The engineering feat described in The Source isnot corroborated or denid by scintifi evidence. The chise marks indicate that they only went on way, but that coul simply indicate which way they dug ou the tunnel to wide it for use. Some other theories include shfts dug down from above, people litening from above.%0a%0aThere is still watr in the well, sometimes it reaches up to the tunnel still today.%0a%0aThe rest of the excavation is very interesting as well. The levels of this Tel are very clear in the display today, but if I just look at it, it looks like they just built down the hill (like building 20). But it is clear here that it is different constructions. The Soloman gate (Northern zig-zag gate) is another incredible piece of construction, that combines defense, courts, politics, and commerce.%0a%0aThe granary and stables were also very interesting. The granary was a huge, round hole, with dual spiral stairs so people could be going down and back up at the same time. The Stables were quite large. One reconstruction was a manger, used for both watringg and feeding horses and lifestock. It was made of stone,like most everything else around here, so the romantic images of jesus being born in a woden stable, and the mangerr being made of wood are just fiction. The manger was bookended by upright stones with holes cut through the top for hitching animals to.%0a%0aOne of the amazing things is how archiologists learn how to put back together the constructions and make hypotheses about how life was back then. I can see how thei mins might work whe presented with the remains of a civilization. The holes in the two upright stones as tethers for the animals would probably have come up in a brainstorming session. I was visualizing a pole of some kind going between them, but that was clearly not in the right direction. Obviously, they would have more background in the types of work people did, understanding agriculture, early food and shelter ways, etc, and certainly would build on each others and former knowledge (academic politics and hubris notwithstanding)%0a%0aI could have spent a whole day at Meggido, just crawling around, reading the signs, getting more of a feel for the place, framing more pictures and getting some intersting abstracts of natural and the man-made structures.%0a%0aOn the way to sophoris, we changed plans to go to Nazareth first. We got lost taking a wrong turn and ended up finding a German village. The orchards were full of pomegranites, and the Farm houses were very European: made of stone, square saltbox two-story constructions. A fascinating bonus!%0a%0aWe also dove by a `McDonald's and we all jumped out to take a picture. Some of stepped in the mud, and are now carrying our boots. ;-p%0a%0aSome talk on the politics of the region. Gilla sounds more than a little condescending to my ears, but that might actually be true concern for the Palestinians. I am curious how far we can question politics and religion in this society, where both are held so closely to survival of the race. Some thoughts I had yesterday at Capernaum were about the still strongly anti jewish rhetoric there is in christian commentary, also sounding condescending. The notion that the jews would be unablle to accept jesus's teachings and that he despaired of it leading into thee for the jews aren't somehow as mature as us christians is ludicrous. Perhaps I'm reading too much into this, but it still rankles. I would like to ask gilla about it, but I don't want offend her. Also, I don't to give her the feeling that she is speaking for her whole country, culture, religion, and people. I would need to make it clear that I want her opinion as an individual, and make assurances to both her and myself that I won't draw any conclusions from it.%0a%0a!!12:12 on the way to Nazareth%0a%0aTree planting- reforestation project begun in the 1930's. Jewish / Israeli tradition to plant a tree to celebrate new births. The Law talks about being ready for the Messiah. When the Messiah comes, you must go out and greet Him. There are two exceptions; a womem in labor should continue to give birth, and someone planting a tree should finish. Both are selfless acts/works for the future; building for the future.%0a%0a!!12:32 in Nazareth%0a%0aExtremely crowded, modern city. Industrial more than historical at this point. Still, a few interesting spots. The only protestant church is a baptist church (why that's interesting, I'm not sure) and there were a few others that I glimpsed going by. Major traffic jam going through the city (and this is a light day, john says. ;-)%0a%0aBack to thoughts about the religious conflicts, I feel we are doing a major disservice to each other, either through confronting each other (My God is the one true God, your's isn't) or merely tolerating each other (I will defend your right to worship as you wish) and not actually embracing each other and finding out what is true and good about all our beliefs. Jew, Christian, and Arab, we all share the same God, we differ on his manifestations and prophets, but the news and message is the same. Its when we derive ddogma and ascribe God's truth to interpretations and assume that we know God's will and how we should all behave. Then we go and tell others how they should behave, instead of allowing each to find her/his own relationship with God.%0a%0a!!14:09%0a%0aBishop at Christian High School, St. Margaret's "The world requires fools to question those who think themselves wise."%0a%0aThe school was great. We had a great time talking with the headmaster, and a bunch of students. We chatted about culture, movies%0a%0aOur time with the Bishop was very sobering, and harmonizes well with my comments from earlier today. He is seeking coallition between arab and Israeli, cchristian, Moslem, and Jew. The stats cited were pretty alarming if we're concerned about the continued presence of Arab Christianity in the holy Land. The Bishop is a man of extreme courage and conviction, and has a very strong faith that his projects will work out.%0a%0aHis son is the Headmaster of the school. The scool has about 200 students, but they are expecting to enroll 600 next year with the newly completed addition. They teach academically, it sounds like. They expect students who want to lear,n and are motivated to study.%0a%0aThe plight of Christian Arabs, is great in Israel. They are a moniority in a minority in a minority. As non-Jews, they don't enjoy the benefits of First Class citizenship. Money needed to run schools and provide a first class education are not there, as they are for Government-funded Israeli schools.%0a%0aThey have prospered so far by the generosity of other Churches in richer countries. The Bishop's own political aspirations are also aided by other, more influential nations. He was one person instrumentaal in bringing about the beginning talks between rabin and Arafat.%0a%0aMaking the two connections I made today, the ancient workd of Meggido and the present world of The Bishop, have made this trip as meaningful for me as I could have hoped for. This trip is a real Balm for my weary soul. I already feel very refreshed mentally. The writing is flowing much easier now (when I'm not distracted by Carol's rowdiness) and I am finding some insights into myself. The sense of being cradled in God's hands on the boat in the ggalilee, the sense of wonder and respect for the ancientness of our world, and God's continued patience with the human race. If I were he, and wanted my children to grow and live in peace and harmony, I would have wiped us out long ago. No not really true. Because I love them so dearly, I would never destrou them, but continue to teach them, by sending people such as the Bishop to teach the rest of us That we need to learn to live together; not just peaceful coexistence, but full, outright celebration of the lives and visions and teaching of all our cultures, beliefs, values, saints, and rituals of all of us together. Some would say that the American Democratic notion, but that's only on the surface of what it would really take to bein full accord and supportive alignmet.%0a%0athe bus got stuck going down a steep hill, trying to turn at the bottom of the hill. Took lots of turns to get it out, finally Abraham backed the bus up the hill and came around the other way. Most everyone had gotten off the bus (Ed, Chris, and I were too slow, and so were left on. Thos who got out were having quite a time "helping". One gentleman, a stranger to us all, took charge of directing traffic and helping to try to get the bus to maneuver around the corner. Several people started up talk with the locals; everyone was tring to help out. It was really great to see the cooperation, concern, and interest of these people, strangers all to us, come out and interact with us. One lady who's house was at the bottom of the hill invited people in, and even offered to move her car. This was another bonus adventure on the trip.%0a%0aAbraham is our hero, however. He has gotten us out of many places and wrong turns already. He must have a tough job getting that large bus around the small streets of Israel. He's always cheerful and friendly.%0a%0aWe got back to the hotel around 'pm, and everyone pretty much went off to bed, including me. At 7:20, I awoke, not recalling hearing the alarm go off. John was tired as well, not to mention several others in the group. After dinner, we all met in John Dodson's room for a quiet ceremony remembering Itsak Rabin, who was assassinated this time last year. Carol shared quite a lot the story about their experience of it (they were visiting when it happened) and how they had to give the local people time to grieve their tremendous loss. Likening it to the assination of Kennedy, the country had been pluned into deep sorrow. The Bishop mentioned that soon after the assassination, he wrote to Mrs. Rabin to tell her, "The bullets that ended your husband's life will not end the peace process." I'm not sure if this was insightful or insensitive. The Bishop strikes me as one who doesn't let the potential hurt feelings of some prevent him from doing something for the greater good of his country and people.%0a%0aI am having more connection with my sense of morality on this trip, so far. The sensitivity to the hurtful doctrines of the Christian Church, the treatment of the Christian Arabs, etc., serve to bring out moral reviewer or critic in me. Wouls we (as Christians) be better equipped to welcome people of other faith to our spiritual homes if we didn't have expactations about how they subsequently choose to worahip?%0a%0aThe idea that we or anyone can possibly know how to best govern ndividuals when it doesn't see individuals, only prototypes, stereotypes, and images of the media depicting a broad story in pictures of individuals. There is a crying need for more critical thinking about our own faith and faith processes.%0a%0aBetween the school and his activism, I think the Bishop has the right approach and he will either be successful or another martyr. Ihope the former, he is a good fellow, if a bit polemic in describing the plight of the Arab Christians. Still, it makes sense that the volume on that is turned up, since they aren't likely to to get their story aired by anybody else. They have to provide more focus and volume to get the issurs heard at all.%0a%0aIt is next to impossible for me to get a glimpse of what it means to be in minority, much less a minority in a minority in a minority. This gap is difficult for me to bridge, even though open to it, so it must be next tp inpossible for anyone who may have a preset expectations, history of fear, hatred and repression. How is it going to happen that the average person is going to make a difference in this situation? This calls loudly for someone who is not average; achieving a level wel above mediocriy is obtainable by many, and this is what it takes. Convincing other is going to be most difficult, since I don't have a strong sense of what the Christian Arabs are facing in their oppression.%0a%0a!!Weird stuff seen today:%0a%0aat golani junction, where a memorial to the Golan Heights Brigade. A `McDonald's Built a huge Golden arches. It was visible from far, far away. Finally, even the president commented on it. Finally taken down at request of parents of brigade members. %0a

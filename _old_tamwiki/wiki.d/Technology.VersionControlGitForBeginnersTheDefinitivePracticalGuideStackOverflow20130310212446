How do you create a new project/repository?%0a%0aA git repository is simply a directory containing a special @@.git@@ directory.%0a%0aThis is different from "centralised" version-control systems (like subversion), where a "repository" is hosted on a remote server, which you @@checkout@@ into a "working copy" directory. With git, your working copy ''is'' the repository.%0a%0aSimply run @@git init@@ in the directory which contains the files you wish to track.%0a%0aFor example,%0a%0a(:source lang=bash linenum:)%0acd ~/code/project001/%0agit init%0a(:sourceend:)%0a%0aThis creates a @@.git@@ (hidden) folder in the current directory.%0a%0aTo make a new project, run @@git init@@ with an additional argument (the name of the directory to be created):%0a%0a%0a(:source lang=bash linenum:)%0agit init project002%0a(:sourceend:)%0a%0aThis is equivalent to:%0a%0a(:source lang=bash linenum:)%0amkdir project002%0acd project002%0agit init%0a(:sourceend:)%0a%0aTo check if the current current path is within a git repository, simply run @@git status@@ - if it's not a repository, it will report "fatal: Not a git repository"%0a%0aYou could also list the @@.git@@ directory, and check it contains files/directories similar to the following:%0a%0a(:source lang=text:)%0a$ ls .git%0aHEAD         config       hooks/       objects/ branches/    description  info/        refs/%0a(:sourceend:)%0a%0aIf for whatever reason you wish to "de-git" a repository (you wish to stop using git to track that project), simply remove the @@.git@@ directory at the base level of the repository:%0a%0a(:source lang=bash linenum:)%0acd ~/code/project001/%0arm -rf .git%0a(:sourceend:)%0a%0a>>warning%3c%3c%0a'''Caution:''' This will destroy ''all'' revision history, ''all'' your tags, ''everything'' git has done.%0aIt will not touch the "current" files (the files you can currently see), but previous changes, deleted files and so on will be unrecoverable!%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a!!

Including stage changes, configure git and repositories, push changes, create/checkout/delete branches, merge, and many other things.%0a%0aOne of my favourite features is the "stage line" and "stage hunk" shortcuts in the right-click menu, which lets you commit specific parts of a file.

You can search repositories. The biggest critisism of Gitnub is that it shows history in a linear fashion (a single branch at a time) - it doesn't visualise branching and merging, which can be important with git, although this is a planned improvement.%0a%0a[[http://github.com/Caged/gitnub/wikis | Download links, change log and screenshots]] | [[http://github.com/Caged/gitnub/tree/master | git repository]]%0a%0a!!!

How to configure it to ignore files:%0a%0aThe ability to have git ignore files you don't wish it to track is very useful. To ignore a file or set of files you supply a pattern. The pattern syntax for git is fairly simple, but powerful. It is applicable to all three of the different files I will mention bellow. %0a* A blank line ignores no files, it is generally used as a separator. %0a* Lines staring with [@#@] serve as comments.  %0a* The [@!@] prefix is optional and will negate the pattern. Any negated pattern that matches will override lower precedence patterns.  %0a* Supports advanced expressions and wild cards  %0a** Ex: The pattern: [@*.[oa]@] will ignore all files in the repository ending in .o or .a (object and archive files) %0a* If a pattern has a directory ending with a slash git will only match this directory and paths underneath it. This excludes regular files and symbolic links from the match.  %0a* A leading slash will match all files in that path name.  %0a** Ex: The pattern [@/*.c@] will match the file @@foo.c@@ but not @@bar/awesome.c@@%0a%0aGreat Example from the [[http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitignore.html | gitignore(5)]] man page:%0a%0a(:source lang=bash:)%0a$ git status [...]%0a# Untracked files: [...]%0a#       Documentation/foo.html%0a#       Documentation/gitignore.html%0a#       file.o%0a#       lib.a%0a#       src/internal.o [...]%0a$ cat .git/info/exclude%0a# ignore objects and archives, anywhere in the tree.%0a*.[oa]%0a$ cat Documentation/.gitignore%0a# ignore generated html files,%0a*.html%0a# except foo.html which is maintained by hand%0a!foo.html%0a$ git status [...]%0a# Untracked files: [...]%0a#       Documentation/foo.html [...]%0a(:sourceend:)%0a%0aGenerally there are three different ways to ignore untracked files.%0a%0a# Ignore for all users of the repository:%0a** Add a file named @@.gitignore@@ to the root of your working copy.%0a** Edit @@.gitignore@@ to match your preferences for which files should/shouldn't be ignored.%0a** @@git add .gitignore@@ and commit when you're done.%0a%0a# Ignore for only your copy of the repository:%0a** Add/Edit the file @@$GIT_DIR/info/exclude@@ in your working copy, with your preferred patterns.%0a*** Ex: My working copy is ~/src/project1 so I would edit @@~/src/project1/.git/info/exclude@@%0a** You're done!%0a%0a# Ignore in all situations, on your system:%0a** Global ignore patterns for your system can go in a file named what ever you wish.%0a** Mine personally is called @@~/.gitglobalignore@@%0a** I can then let git know of this file by editing my @@~/.gitconfig@@ file with the following line:%0a*** @@core.excludesfile = ~/.gitglobalignore@@%0a** You're done!%0a%0aI find the [[http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitignore.html | gitignore]] man page to be the best resource for more information.%0a%0a[[#322967]]%0a%0a||%0a||[[ | up vote]] 47 [[ | down vote]] ||! How do you 'tag' a particular set of revisions''How do you 'mark' 'tag' or 'release' a particular set of revisions for a particular set of files so you can always pull that one later?''Using the @@git tag@@ command.To simply "tag" the current revision, you would just run.. @@git tag -a thetagname git tag -a 0.1 git tag -a 2.6.1-rc1 -m 'Released on 01/02/03'@@To list the current tags, simply run @@git tag@@ with no arguments, or @@-l@@ (lower case L): @@$ git tag -a thetagname # and enter a message, or use -m 'My tag annotation' $ git tag -l thetagname@@To delete a tag, you use the @@-d@@ flag: @@$ git tag -d thetagname  Deleted tag 'thetagname' $ git tag [no output]@@To tag a specific (previous) commit, you simply do.. @@git tag [tag name] [revision SHA1 hash]@@For example: @@git tag 1.1.1 81b15a68c6c3e71f72e766931df4e6499990385b@@ ---- Note: by default, git creates a "lightweight" tag (basically a reference to a specific revision). The "right" way is to use the @@-a@@ flag.

You could create a new branch, what we could call a "feature" branch, something that will take some time and might break some code. Once your feature is "stable enough" and want to move it "closer" to production, you merge your feature branch into develop. When all the bugs are sorted out after the merge and your code passes all tests rock solid, you push your changes into master.During all this process, you find a terrible security bug, that has to be fixed right away. You could have a branch called hotfixes, that make changes that are pushed quicker back into production than the normal "develop" branch.Here you have an illustration of how this feature/hotfix/develop/production workflow might look like (well explained in the blog post, and I repeat, the blog post explains the whole process in a lot more detail and a lot better than I do.http://i.stack.imgur.com/6rDUk.png||  ||[[http://stackoverflow.com:80/a/5968622 | share]] || edited [[http://stackoverflow.com:80/posts/5968622/revisions | May 13 '11 at 9:37]] [[%3c%3c]]|| community wiki  [[%3c%3c]] [[http://stackoverflow.com:80/posts/5968622/revisions |  3 revs [[%3c%3c]] ashwoods ]]|| ||%0a|| ||||  || || ||[[ | show '''5''' more comments]] ||%0a%0a[[#2678236]]%0a%0a||%0a||[[ | up vote]] 39 [[ | down vote]] ||Here's a copy of PJ Hyett's post, as it is not available anymore: ->!!

How to configure it to ignore files:%0a%3c %0a%3c The ability to have git ignore files you don't wish it to track is very useful. To ignore a file or set of files you supply a pattern. The pattern syntax for git is fairly simple, but powerful. It is applicable to all three of the different files I will mention bellow. %0a%3c * A blank line ignores no files, it is generally used as a separator. %0a%3c * Lines staring with [@#@] serve as comments.  %0a%3c * The [@!@] prefix is optional and will negate the pattern.

You could create a new branch, what we could call a "feature" branch, something that will take some time and might break some code. Once your feature is "stable enough" and want to move it "closer" to production, you merge your feature branch into develop. When all the bugs are sorted out after the merge and your code passes all tests rock solid, you push your changes into master.During all this process, you find a terrible security bug, that has to be fixed right away. You could have a branch called hotfixes, that make changes that are pushed quicker back into production than the normal "develop" branch.Here you have an illustration of how this feature/hotfix/develop/production workflow might look like (well explained in the blog post, and I repeat, the blog post explains the whole process in a lot more detail and a lot better than I do.http://i.stack.imgur.com/6rDUk.png||  ||[[http://stackoverflow.com:80/a/5968622 | share]] || edited [[http://stackoverflow.com:80/posts/5968622/revisions | May 13 '11 at 9:37]] [[%3c%3c]]|| community wiki  [[%3c%3c]] [[http://stackoverflow.com:80/posts/5968622/revisions |  3 revs [[%3c%3c]] ashwoods ]]|| ||%0a%3c || ||||  || || ||[[ | show '''5''' more comments]] ||%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#2678236]]%0a%3c %0a---%0a> ||[[ | up vote]] 110 [[ | down vote]] ||!

How to configure it to ignore files:The ability to have git ignore files you don't wish it to track is very useful.To ignore a file or set of files you supply a pattern. The pattern syntax for git is fairly simple, but powerful. It is applicable to all three of the different files I will mention bellow. * A blank line ignores no files, it is generally used as a separator. * Lines staring with '''#''' serve as comments.  * The '''!''' prefix is optional and will negate the pattern. Any negated pattern that matches will override lower precedence patterns.  * Supports advanced expressions and wild cards  ** Ex: The pattern: '''*.[oa]''' will ignore all files in the repository ending in .o or .a (object and archive files) * If a pattern has a directory ending with a slash git will only match this directory and paths underneath it. This excludes regular files and symbolic links from the match.  * A leading slash will match all files in that path name.  ** Ex: The pattern '''/*.c''' will match the file '''foo.c''' but not '''bar/awesome.c'''Great Example from the [[http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitignore.html | gitignore(5)]] man page: @@$ git status [...] # Untracked files: [...] #       Documentation/foo.html #       Documentation/gitignore.html #       file.o #       lib.a #       src/internal.o [...] $ cat .git/info/exclude   # ignore objects and archives, anywhere in the tree.   *.[oa] $ cat Documentation/.gitignore # ignore generated html files, *.html # except foo.html which is maintained by hand !foo.html $ git status [...] # Untracked files: [...] #       Documentation/foo.html [...]@@ ---- Generally there are three different ways to ignore untracked files.'''1) Ignore for all users of the repository:'''Add a file named '''.gitignore''' to the root of your working copy.Edit '''.gitignore''' to match your preferences for which files should/shouldn't be ignored. @@git add .gitignore@@and commit when you're done.'''2) Ignore for only your copy of the repository:'''Add/Edit the file '''$GIT_DIR/info/exclude''' in your working copy, with your preferred patterns.Ex: My working copy is ~/src/project1 so I would edit '''~/src/project1/.git/info/exclude'''You're done!'''3) Ignore in all situations, on your system:'''Global ignore patterns for your system can go in a file named what ever you wish.Mine personally is called '''~/.gitglobalignore'''I can then let git know of this file by editing my '''~/.gitconfig''' file with the following line: @@core.excludesfile = ~/.gitglobalignore@@You're done!I find the [[http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitignore.html | gitignore]] man page to be the best resource for more information.||  ||[[http://stackoverflow.com:80/a/316062 | share]] || edited [[http://stackoverflow.com:80/posts/316062/revisions | Nov 25 '08 at 1:19]][[http://stackoverflow.com:80/users/893/greg-hewgill | http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/747ffa5da3538e66840ebc0548b8fd58?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG]][[http://stackoverflow.com:80/users/893/greg-hewgill | Greg Hewgill]] [[%3c%3c]] 265k50512721|| answered Nov 25 '08 at 1:04[[http://stackoverflow.com:80/users/3415/brian-gianforcaro | http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cd627b21eb027107a4199884d0b92f20?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG]][[http://stackoverflow.com:80/users/3415/brian-gianforcaro | Brian Gianforcaro]] [[%3c%3c]] 9,12652953|| ||%0a> || ||||  || || ||[[ | show '''4''' more comments]] ||%0a> %0a> [[#322967]]%0a> %0a356,360c54,58%0a%3c ||[[ | up vote]] 32 [[ | down vote]] ||!

You could create a new branch, what we could call a "feature" branch, something that will take some time and might break some code. Once your feature is "stable enough" and want to move it "closer" to production, you merge your feature branch into develop. When all the bugs are sorted out after the merge and your code passes all tests rock solid, you push your changes into master.During all this process, you find a terrible security bug, that has to be fixed right away. You could have a branch called hotfixes, that make changes that are pushed quicker back into production than the normal "develop" branch.Here you have an illustration of how this feature/hotfix/develop/production workflow might look like (well explained in the blog post, and I repeat, the blog post explains the whole process in a lot more detail and a lot better than I do.http://i.stack.imgur.com/6rDUk.png||  ||[[http://stackoverflow.com:80/a/5968622 | share]] || edited [[http://stackoverflow.com:80/posts/5968622/revisions | May 13 '11 at 9:37]] [[%3c%3c]]|| community wiki  [[%3c%3c]] [[http://stackoverflow.com:80/posts/5968622/revisions |  3 revs [[%3c%3c]] ashwoods ]]|| ||%0a> || ||||  || || ||[[ | show '''5''' more comments]] ||%0a> %0a> [[#2678236]]%0a> %0a368,376c66,70%0a%3c ||[[ | up vote]] 28 [[ | down vote]] ||@@git status@@ is your friend, use it often.

How do you create a new project/repository?A git repository is simply a directory containing a special @@.git@@ directory.This is different from "centralised" version-control systems (like subversion), where a "repository" is hosted on a remote server, which you @@checkout@@ into a "working copy" directory.

How to configure it to ignore files:The ability to have git ignore files you don't wish it to track is very useful.To ignore a file or set of files you supply a pattern. The pattern syntax for git is fairly simple, but powerful. It is applicable to all three of the different files I will mention bellow. * A blank line ignores no files, it is generally used as a separator. * Lines staring with '''#''' serve as comments.  * The '''!''' prefix is optional and will negate the pattern. Any negated pattern that matches will override lower precedence patterns.  * Supports advanced expressions and wild cards  ** Ex: The pattern: '''*.[oa]''' will ignore all files in the repository ending in .o or .a (object and archive files) * If a pattern has a directory ending with a slash git will only match this directory and paths underneath it. This excludes regular files and symbolic links from the match.  * A leading slash will match all files in that path name.  ** Ex: The pattern '''/*.c''' will match the file '''foo.c''' but not '''bar/awesome.c'''Great Example from the [[http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitignore.html | gitignore(5)]] man page: @@$ git status [...] # Untracked files: [...] #       Documentation/foo.html #       Documentation/gitignore.html #       file.o #       lib.a #       src/internal.o [...] $ cat .git/info/exclude   # ignore objects and archives, anywhere in the tree.   *.[oa] $ cat Documentation/.gitignore # ignore generated html files, *.html # except foo.html which is maintained by hand !foo.html $ git status [...] # Untracked files: [...] #       Documentation/foo.html [...]@@ ---- Generally there are three different ways to ignore untracked files.'''1) Ignore for all users of the repository:'''Add a file named '''.gitignore''' to the root of your working copy.Edit '''.gitignore''' to match your preferences for which files should/shouldn't be ignored. @@git add .gitignore@@and commit when you're done.'''2) Ignore for only your copy of the repository:'''Add/Edit the file '''$GIT_DIR/info/exclude''' in your working copy, with your preferred patterns.Ex: My working copy is ~/src/project1 so I would edit '''~/src/project1/.git/info/exclude'''You're done!'''3) Ignore in all situations, on your system:'''Global ignore patterns for your system can go in a file named what ever you wish.Mine personally is called '''~/.gitglobalignore'''I can then let git know of this file by editing my '''~/.gitconfig''' file with the following line: @@core.excludesfile = ~/.gitglobalignore@@You're done!I find the [[http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitignore.html | gitignore]] man page to be the best resource for more information.||  ||[[http://stackoverflow.com:80/a/316062 | share]] || edited [[http://stackoverflow.com:80/posts/316062/revisions | Nov 25 '08 at 1:19]][[http://stackoverflow.com:80/users/893/greg-hewgill | http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/747ffa5da3538e66840ebc0548b8fd58?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG]][[http://stackoverflow.com:80/users/893/greg-hewgill | Greg Hewgill]] [[%3c%3c]] 265k50512721|| answered Nov 25 '08 at 1:04[[http://stackoverflow.com:80/users/3415/brian-gianforcaro | http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cd627b21eb027107a4199884d0b92f20?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG]][[http://stackoverflow.com:80/users/3415/brian-gianforcaro | Brian Gianforcaro]] [[%3c%3c]] 9,12652953|| ||%0a%3c || ||||  || || ||[[ | show '''4''' more comments]] ||%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#322967]]%0a%3c %0a%3c ||%0a%3c ||[[ | up vote]] 47 [[ | down vote]] ||!

You could create a new branch, what we could call a "feature" branch, something that will take some time and might break some code.

When all the bugs are sorted out after the merge and your code passes all tests rock solid, you push your changes into master.During all this process, you find a terrible security bug, that has to be fixed right away. You could have a branch called hotfixes, that make changes that are pushed quicker back into production than the normal "develop" branch.Here you have an illustration of how this feature/hotfix/develop/production workflow might look like (well explained in the blog post, and I repeat, the blog post explains the whole process in a lot more detail and a lot better than I do.http://i.stack.imgur.com/6rDUk.png||  ||[[http://stackoverflow.com:80/a/5968622 | share]] || edited [[http://stackoverflow.com:80/posts/5968622/revisions | May 13 '11 at 9:37]] [[%3c%3c]]|| community wiki  [[%3c%3c]] [[http://stackoverflow.com:80/posts/5968622/revisions |  3 revs [[%3c%3c]] ashwoods ]]|| ||%0a%3c || ||||  || || ||[[ | show '''5''' more comments]] ||%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#2678236]]%0a%3c %0a%3c ||%0a%3c ||[[ | up vote]] 39 [[ | down vote]] ||Here's a copy of PJ Hyett's post, as it is not available anymore: ->!!

Only one command in both cases.||  ||[[http://stackoverflow.com:80/a/2678236 | share]] || answered [[http://stackoverflow.com:80/posts/2678236/revisions | Apr 20 '10 at 20:02]] [[%3c%3c]]|| community wiki  [[%3c%3c]] [[http://stackoverflow.com:80/posts/2678236/revisions |  Adam Davis ]]|| ||%0a%3c || ||||  ||||  ||3 || || ||Original link was [[http://www.pjhyett.com/posts/234-git-isn-t-hard | pjhyett.com/posts/234-git-isn-t-hard]] &ndash;&nbsp;[[http://stackoverflow.com:80/users/2915/adam-davis | Adam Davis]] Apr 20 '10 at 20:05 || ||||  ||3 || || ||[[http://pjhyett.com/2008/11/23/git-isnt-hard.html | pjhyett.com/2008/11/23/git-isnt-hard.html]] &ndash;&nbsp;[[http://stackoverflow.com:80/users/849078/adam-jurczyk | Adam Jurczyk]] Sep 23 '11 at 20:47 ||[[ | show '''1''' more comment]] ||%0a%3c %0a%3c [[#323764]]%0a%3c %0a%3c ||%0a%3c ||[[ | up vote]] 33 [[ | down vote]] ||!

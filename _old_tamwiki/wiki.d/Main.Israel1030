I slept pretty well, I tink I got about 7 hours of sleep. I'm definitely awake now!%0a%0aLeaving Israel was much easier logistically than going. The questions were much shorter, more perfunctory. The guy load bags into the security scanner was really abrupt, not waiting for us to be ready. I almost lost my pouch!%0a%0aAnyway, all else went very smoothly. Gilla saw us through the security checkpoint and up to baggage check-in. Then we were on our own.

Then getting on was real straight-forward for me. Thank heavens that Gilla was able to get me a seat much further from smoking. The seat I'm in now is actually really good, one row behind the bulkhead. Granted its not an aisle seat, but it is comfortable enough.%0a%0aProcessing the feelings I have about leaving Israel, the land and people is much harder. There were lots of hugs all around. Both Carol and Julie said they wished I were coming along on the jordan extension. I wish I was, too. I have been having so much fun with them. I think there is some infatuation there, but not romantic; everyone loves Carol-that's basically who she is! Jules is also lots of fun, and she tried to recruit me again for morning glory choir. Nice to be asked, but it wouldn't work out.%0a%0aI wonder how the girls are doing; I'll be glad to get home to see them. I am also hoping Yvonne will be happy to see me. That is what I am dreading right now; is there going to be any change in our relationship? When I left, it seemed as though we had slipped back to the comfortable non-threatening detente we've had lately. I'd like to be able to go someplace from there- either to an warming of the relationship, or to deciding we want to be free of it. The detente point could become permanent, but neither of us would thrive if we were forced (or forcing ourselves) to continue to live in that sort of relationship as our primary source of love and support.%0a%0aTravelling has made such an impact upon me. I am at once refreshed and invigorated by al I have seen and done. The sense of history, of continuity with the past is deep. I can still recall the feelings of transportation back into the ancient times at the Roman city at Bet She'an, and the wonder of the water tunnel at Meggido, and the desperation on Masada.%0a%0aI guess what I'm dreading most is coming back to a lot of bills on the credit card. I don't know why I should be so afraid, however, since it is up to me to figure out how to pay it off. The film cost on top of the big charge at the Best Buys place, plus my car maintenace will add up to over $500! I'll have to look at the budget for Suzie and at the HPCU account to see if there is some relief to be gained there, otherwise, I could cash in more stock. I don't necessarily want to do that, however, if we might need it for taxes. If we need more cash for Yvonne to bu a new instrument for her, and another one for Rachel, then I wil feel better about cashing in stock for my trip expenses, too.%0a%0aI think it will be a couple of days still, before I can process all I've seen, felt and done. I keep slipping back into more mundane details, and not describing anything I'm feeling. I guess I'm right now feeling sad for having to leave Israel, Carol and Jules. I'm feeling a sense of anticipation for seeing the ladies and Yvonne. I'm feeling apprehensive about my relationship with Yvonne. I'm feeling indifferent about work. I'm really looking forward to getting my pictures developed. I'm looking forward to collating all the material I've written into a cohesive remembrance of the trip.%0a%0aI didn't spend as nuch time with some of the people on this trip as I would have liked; Liz and John D. -- we talked only a little bit. Bill and Barbara were fun, but I didn't really get to know them, i didn't realize Bill had such a sense of humor until late in the trip. Chris and Ed I got to know pretty well, as well as Jim and Carole. John Vlay was a lot of fun, a good roomie. Hal was sort of an enigma to me, but he was funny and friendly, too. Reed was just sort of Reed; the introverted thinker type, typical of engineers, but also warm, friendly and interesting when aproached (probably much like I am).%0a%0aNancy R. was pretty much as I expected she would be, friendly and earnest about what interests her, and more than willing to impose it on us. She's nice, but I'm not comfortable around her for some reason. I liked judith a lot, she seemed cold before, but that may be simply shyness or simply a quiet personality. Mary Rees was also an enigma; a very private person, friendly but not outgoing. I wonder if she felt overwhelmed by the trip.

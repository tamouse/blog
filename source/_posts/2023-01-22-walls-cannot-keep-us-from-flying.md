From kottke.org: “Jonathan Mehring’s short documentary https://www.documentary.org/project/walls-cannot-keep-us-flying follows two young Palestinians who have found freedom in skateboarding while surrounded by walls & barbed wire and facing harassment from Israeli authorities and their own families & communities.”

# Pockets of Resistance

John Kottke brings an important notice to a documentary about a couple of Palestinian youth seeking to express their freedom through skateboarding, while under the constant reminder of occupation by Israeli forces.

The film is available on youtube at: [https://youtu.be/TSIe_twCYnc](https://youtu.be/TSIe_twCYnc)

The Instagram account, [walls_film](https://www.instagram.com/walls_film/), shows various cuts and images of the movie, and seems like a good place to keep up.

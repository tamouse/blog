You know that saying, that if you live in a place, you don't know the attractions. But when friends come to visit, what do you do? I wrote this a few years ago but never got around to publishing it, so here's my list. A few places to eat, things to see, etc., in Minneapolis/St. Paul:

## Museums, etc:

- The American Swedish Institute, <http://asimn.org>
- Walker Art Center, <http://walkerart.org>
- Minneapolis Institute of Art, <http://artsmia.org>
- Mill City Museum, <http://millcitymuseum.org>
- Science Museum of Minnesota (St. Paul), <http://smn.org>

## Famous Buildings:

- St. Mary's Basilica, Minneapolis
- Cathedral of St. Paul, St. Paul

## Theatre:

- Guthrie Theatre, <http://guthrie.org>
- Jungle Theatre, <http://jungletheatre.com>

(There is *so much* theatre here in the Twin Cities.)

## Nature:

The Twin Cities has lots of open space, parks, walking trails, etc.

- Minnesota Landscape Arboretum: <http://www.arboretum.umn.edu>
- Minnesota Zoo, <http://mnzoo.org>
- Como Park Zoo and Conservatory, <http://comozooconservatory.org>
- National Eagle Center, <http://www.nationaleaglecenter.org>

## Food:

The Twin Cities is pretty cosmopolitan, you can find almost anything here. Personally, I stay away from fish/seafood places with a couple of exception, probably not worth mentioning as they're chains.

- Amore Victoria, Italian, <http://amorevictoria.com> - this place has amazing dishes, superbly prepared. Beware the quantities are huge.
- Christos Greek Restaurant, 3 locations, <http://christos.com>
- Cossetta's Italian Market and Pizzeria, <http://cossettas.com>
- Heartland Restaurant & Market, farm-direct-to-table, fresh, ever changing menu, <http://heartlandrestaurant.com>
- Pizza Luc√© (several locations), <https://pizzaluce.com/> - the best pizza ever! They also have gluten-free crust and dairy-free cheese. These people are amazing, and are hugely civic minded.
- Smack Shack, one exception to my seafood restriction, a North Loop (warehouse district) establishment, <http://smack-shack.com> -- their catfish hoagie is amazing.
- Thanh Do Restaurant, pan-asian cuisine, St. Louis Park, <http://thanhdorestaurant.com>
- The Birchwood Cafe, Minneapolis, <http://birchwoodcafe.com> - fresh food, great dessert case
- Vincent, <http://www.vincentarestaurant.com>

### closer to home

- The King and I Thai <https://www.kingandithai.com/> - an awesome Thai restaurant
- Teresa's <http://teresasmn.com/> - really excellent Mexican fare
- Haiku Japanese Bistro - <https://www.haikujapanese.com/stpaul/> - very local, very Japanese; I will eat their sushi / sashimi

Sadly, I can't comment on night-life, as I don't have any.

### Grocery Stores

- Mississippi Market, <https://msmarket.coop/>, a coop with great stuff for vegan and other alternative eating styles
- HyVee, <https://www.hy-vee.com/>, a huge superstore style grocer, employee-owned, slowly moving into the Twin Cities Metro
- Kowalski Markets, <https://www.kowalskis.com/>, smaller stores, focused on locally grown and sourced foods, high quality

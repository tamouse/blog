[Imogen Heap](http://www.imogenheap.com) knows how to connect with her
fans, build an audience, and give them a chance to be part of the
creation of her work. 

Currently working on a new album, the final song
is to include as many voices of her fans as possible. Imogen
[invited](http://www.imogenheap.com/2013/08/09/add-your-voice-to-the-listening-chair/)
her fans to drop recordings of themselves saying "Who am I now?" on a
[soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com) group.

This is how it's done, folks.

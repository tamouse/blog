Jessica Slice is a mom with Euler-Daniels Syndrome (EDS) which means she has limited ability to walk, stand and so on. It means she needs to use a wheelchair. It does **not** mean she is "confined to a wheelchair", an archaic, ablist, and destructive notion. She wrote an article for the New York Times about it.

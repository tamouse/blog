I've recently come across [GoldieBlox](http://www.goldieblox.com)
which is a startup with a
[kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/16029337/goldieblox-the-engineering-toy-for-girls)
which has successfully met it's funding goal to create a set of
construction toys aimed at young girls.

While the goal is laudable, it could be carried out in a way that
undermines the goal. GoldieBlox seems to get it, and I think this will
appeal.

Even so, I'm left wondering, what is it about other sorts of
construction toys that end up not appealing to young girls. I think
something like GoldieBlox may be needed, not because there is anything
inherent or intrinsic that it has that appeals more to girls than
boys, or that, for example, LEGO has that appeals more the girls than
boys, but all the meta-messaging around them.

Here's what the inventor, Debbie Sterling, has to say about it:

> ### Designed for girls

> GoldieBlox goes beyond "making it pink" to appeal to girls. I spent
  a year doing in-depth research into gender differences and child
  development to create the concept. My big "aha"? Boys have strong
  spatial skills, which is why they love construction toys so
  much. Girls, on the other hand, have superior verbal skills. They
  love reading, stories, and characters.


> GoldieBlox is the best of both worlds: reading + building. It
  appeals to girls because they aren't just interested in "what"
  they're building...they want to know "why." Goldie's stories relate
  to girls' lives. The machines Goldie builds solve problems and help
  her friends. As girls read along, they want to be like Goldie and do
  what she does. 


> Goldie's toolkit is inspired by common household objects and craft
items -- things girls are already familiar with. Plus, the set
features soft textures, curved edges and attractive colors which are
all innately appealing to girls. Last but not least, the story of
Goldie is lighthearted and humorous. It takes the intimidation factor
out of engineering and makes it fun and accessible. 
 
## Kickstarter and Publicity

The [GoldieBlox Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/16029337/goldieblox-the-engineering-toy-for-girls)
was fully funded in October 2013, and they are seeking to get
promotion during the Superbowl running an ad. They currently have a
fabulous video of a Rube-Goldberg-style construction, which is pretty
fun, while the lyrics of the music being sung are pretty strongly
confrontational against the traditional stereotypes of what
constitutes "girls' toys" and "boys' toys."

## Post script

I just found Debbie's TEDx talk, and I think I understand. GoldieBlox
appeals to girls on multiple levels, with multiple points of
contact. But more than that, it appeals to parents who have seen the
gender divide in what is available for them in the mainstream in terms
of what toys you can give to little kids. The pink aisle, vs. the blue
aisle. GoldieBlox is breaking this scheme, not be providing something
other than pink, but by providing a product that transcends the
stereotype of what pink means: dolls, dolls, dolls.

Here's Debbie's TED talk:

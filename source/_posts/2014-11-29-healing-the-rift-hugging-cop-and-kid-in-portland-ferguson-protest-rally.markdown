This image was taken by freelance photographer [Johnny Nguyen] and published in [the Oregonian] telling the story about the young [Devonte Hart], a young man wearing a sign saying "Free Hugs" was at the rally, and a Portland police seargent, Bret Barnum, engaged him in conversation, ending in the hug depicted above.

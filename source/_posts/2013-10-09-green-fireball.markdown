Another awesome photo from Randy Halverson of [Dakotalapse](http://www.dakotalapse.com "Dakotalapse")
showing a green fireball -- the streak on the left side of the page.

Randy's words:

> Green Fireball - I saw the green fireball with my eyes (green trail
  on the left), shortly after I started this timelapse. It moved from
  left to right and lasted several seconds. In Buffalo Gap National
  Grassland &mdash; Randy Halverson, Dakotalapse

I *so* love Randy's work. His epic ["Horizons"](http://vimeo.com/67621971) film fills me with wonder and joy.
I just can't get enough of his stuff.

(Click on the image to get a really big view of it.)

I just found out about the [Goblin
Shark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblin_shark) today via *[Mental
Floss](http://www.mentalfloss.com) Watercooler Ammo news.* It's an
extraordinary creature, with a very scary looking snout, and the most
amazing ability to **thrust it's jaws out of it's mouth** to capture
it's prey. Talk about your *Alien* shark!!.

The sequence above is taken from a [Japanese video fragment on
Youtube](http://youtu.be/nXJuQadirE0) (*Japanese language, no
translation*).

This is the explanation from Mental Floss:

> *Mitsukurina owstoni*, also known as the goblin shark, doesn't look
like any shark you've seen before. These deep sea denizens can grow up
to 13 feet and have a pinkish-gray coloration and a long, flattened
snout. And when they feed, they become scarier than any Great White. 

> Normally, the *M. owstoni*'s jaws -- which are lined with sharp,
needle-like teeth -- sit flush with the underside of its head. But to
capture its prey, the shark [thrusts its jaw
forward](http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Gallery/Descript/goblinshark/goblinshark.html),
almost to the end of its snout, like a deep sea version of Hungry
Hungry Hippos. Based on the seven specimens retrieved with
identifiable stomach contents, as well as the slender shape of its
mouth, scientists think the shark's diet probably includes teleost or
finned fish, squid, and crabs. 

> Since it was first discovered in 1898 off of Yokohama, Japan, fewer
than 50 goblin shark specimens have been found. (One shark, captured
alive in 2007, was exhibited at an aquarium in Japan for a short time
before it died.) Scientists believe M. owstoni lives at depths from
130 feet to 4,265 feet -- which means they probably won't be coming to
a beach near you anytime soon. But if you want to see the shark in
action, there's always [YouTube](http://youtu.be/nXJuQadirE0).

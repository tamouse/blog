Vincent van Gogh 1853 - 1890 »Souvenir de Mauve«

![]({{ page.gallery.large}})

Vincent van Gogh's *Peach Trees in Blossom (Souvenir de Mauve)* is an
oil on canvas (28-3/4x23-1/2 inches) that is housed in the
Kröller-Müller Museum in Otterlo, Netherlands.

## Peach Trees in Blossom (Souvenir de Mauve) by Vincent van Gogh

> When the weather in Arles, France, turned mild in March, Vincent van
Gogh reveled in the changing landscape. He painted Peach Trees in
Blossom (Souvenir de Mauve) in 1888.  By the end of March all the
fruit trees -- plum, apricot, pear, apple, and cherry -- were either
budded or in full bloom. Van Gogh worked rapidly with flickering
strokes to capture the beautiful but fleeting effect. While painting
pink peach trees he received news of the death of Anton Mauve. The
older painter had urged van Gogh to use color freely, and Vincent
dedicated this painting to his memory.

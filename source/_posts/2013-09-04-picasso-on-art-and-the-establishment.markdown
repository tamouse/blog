I'm not clear on the source of this (who is the "I" in this story) but
follows a story of Picasso's reaction to receiving a telegram
requesting his support in an effort to stem a wave of anti-art
sentiment from American politicos.

> One morning, soon after Miro had left, a special delivery letter
> arrived from Kahnweiler in Paris. Enclosed with Kahnweiler's letter
> was a cable from New York.

&nbsp;

> We had been hearing wildly fantastic stories about American
> congressmen fulminating against modern art as politically
> subversive-- the kind of rabble-rousing speech that Hitler used to
> make in the thirties and that the Russians go in for now -- the only
> difference being that the American congressmen saw it all as part of
> a Communist plot and the Russians call it "bourgeois decadence." The
> resistance to the lunatic fringe on this American subcultural front
> apparently centered about the Museum of Modern Art in New York and
> the cable was a real cri du coeur from the stoutly pumping heart of
> that center of resistance. It was signed by the painter Stuart
> Davis, the sculptor Lipchitz, and James Johnson Sweeney, at that
> period director of painting and sculpture at the museum. It was
> addressed to Pablo in care of Kahnweiler's gallery and read:

&nbsp;

>> SERIOUS WAVE OF ANIMOSITY TOWARDS FREE EXPRESSION PAINTING SCULPTURE
>> MOUNTING IN AMERICAN PRESS AND MUSEUMS STOP GRAVE RENEWED PRESSURE
>> FAVORING MEDIOCRE AND UTILITARIAN STOP ARTISTS WRITERS REAFFIRMING
>> RIGHTS HOLD MEETING MUSEUM MODERN ART MAY FIFTH STOP YOUR SUPPORT
>> WOULD MEAN MUCH TO ISSUE COULD CABLE STATEMENT EMPHASIZING NECESSITY
>> FOR TOLERATION OF INNOVATION IN ART TO SWEENEY 177 BROADWAY

&nbsp;


> Attached to the message was a prepaid reply voucher. I translated
> the cable for Pablo and then read him Kahnweiler's
> letter. Kahnweiler had read the cable before forwarding it --
> "delirious" was his word for it. As far as the mounting wave
> animosity toward free expression in art was concerned, Who cares?
> Kahnweiler asked; nobody worries about people like that, he said. On
> the other hand, maybe he was wrong and Pablo would feel it was
> necessary to emphasize the necessity for the toleration of
> innovation in art.

&nbsp;

> Pablo shook his head. "Kahnweiler's right," he said. "The point is,
> art is something subversive. It's something that should not be
> free. Art and liberty, like the fire of Prometheus, are things one
> must steal, to be used against the established order. Once art
> becomes official and open to everyone, then it becomes the new
> academicism." He tossed the cablegram down onto the table. "How can
> I support an idea like that? If art is ever given the keys to the
> city, it will be because it's been so watered down, rendered
> impotent, that it's not worth fighting for."
>

&nbsp;

> I reminded him that Malherbe had said a poet is of no more use to
> the state than a man who spends his time playing ninepins. "Of
> course," Pablo said. "And why did Plato say poets should be chased
> out of the republic? Precisely because every poet and every artist
> is an anti-social being. He's not that way because he wants to be;
> he can't be any other way. Of course the state has the right to
> chase him away-- from its point of view-- and if he is really an
> artist it is in his nature not to want to be admitted, because if he
> is admitted it can only mean he is doing something which is
> understood, approved, and therefore old hat-- worthless. Anything
> new, anything worth doing, can't be recognized. People just don't
> have that much vision. So this business about defending and freeing
> culture is absurd. One can defend culture in a broad, general sense,
> if you mean by that heritage of the past, but the right to free
> expression is something one seizes, not something one is given. It
> isn't a principle one can lay down as something that should
> exist. The only principle involved is that if it does exist, it
> exists to be used against the established order. Only the Russians
> are naive enough to think that an artist can fit into
> society. That's because they don't know what an artist is. What can
> the state do with the real artists, the seers? Rimbaud in Russia is
> unthinkable. Even Mayakowsky committed suicide. There is absolute
> opposition between the creator and the state. So there's only one
> tactic for the state-- kill the seers. If the idea of society is to
> dominate the idea of the individual, the individual must
> perish. Furthermore, there wouldn't be such a thing as a seer if
> there weren't a state trying to suppress him. It's only at that
> moment, under that pressure, that he becomes one. People reach the
> status of artist only after crossing the maximum number of
> barriers. So the arts should be discouraged, not encouraged.

&nbsp;

> "The thing that's wrong with modern art right now," he said, "and we
> might as well say it-- it's dying-- is the fact that there isn't any
> longer a strong, powerful academic art worth fighting against. There
> has to be a rule even if it's a bad one because evidence of art's
> power is breaking down the barriers. But to do away with obstacles--
> that serves no purpose other than to make things completely
> wishy-washy, spineless, shapeless, meaningless-- zero."

&nbsp;

> Pablo studied the prepaid answer form. "Well," he said, "they wasted
> their nine hundred and thirty-eight francs on me." He tossed it into
> the basket.

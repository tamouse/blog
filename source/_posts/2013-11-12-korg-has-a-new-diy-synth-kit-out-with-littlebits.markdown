[Korg](http://www.korgusa.com/ "korgusa.com") and
[LittleBits](http://littlebits.cc/ "littlebits.cc") have produced a
snazzy little snap-together set of parts to make a
[synthesizer](http://littlebits.cc/kits/synth-kit) that comes packaged
for instant music making. This is something I would love to get my
hands on, and seems like something that would be really cool to bring
into schools.

Here's a video of Reggie Watts, using the synth kit:

In 1852, Frederick Douglass, one of the most powerful voices for
the abolition of slavery was asked to give an address on the American
Independence day holiday.

Herewith, his words:


> Fellow-citizens,
> pardon me, allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here
> to-day? What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national
> independence? Are the great principles of political freedom and of
> natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence,
> extended to us? And am I, therefore, called upon to bring our humble
> offering to the national altar, and to confess the benefits and
> express devout gratitude for the blessings resulting from your
> independence to us?

> I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary! Your
> high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between
> us. The blessings in which you this day rejoice are not enjoyed in
> common. The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity, and
> independence bequeathed by your fathers is shared by you, not by
> me. The sunlight that brought life and healing to you has brought
> stripes and death to me. This Fourth of July is yours, not mine. You
> may rejoice, I must mourn. To drag a man in fetters into the grand
> illuminated temple of liberty, and call upon him to join you in
> joyous anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony. Do you
> mean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to speak today?

> What, to the American slave, is your Fourth of July? I answer: a day
> that reveals to him, more than all other days of the year, the gross
> injustice and cruelty to which he is a constant victim. To him, your
> celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your
> national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are
> empty and heartless; your denunciation of tyrants, brass fronted
> impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your
> prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your
> religious parade and solemnity, are, to Him, mere bombast, fraud,
> deception, impiety, and hypocrisy—a thin veil to cover up crimes
> that would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation of
> the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the
> people of these United States at this very hour.

> At a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is
> needed. O! had I the ability, and could reach the nation’s ear, I
> would, to-day, pour forth a stream, a fiery stream of biting
> ridicule, blasting reproach, withering sarcasm, and stern
> rebuke. For it is not light that is needed, but fire; it is not the
> gentle shower, but thunder. We need the storm, the whirlwind, the
> earthquake. The feeling of the nation must be quickened; the
> conscience of the nation must be roused; the propriety of the nation
> must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; and
> the crimes against God and man must be proclaimed and denounced.

Yamaha has put up a set of concept bikes for the Tokyo Motor
Show. I've been interested in electric motorcycles for a while now,
years, even. I had an electric scooter at one point, but it was a very
underpowered thing that I didn't really consider safe enough for heavy
traffic areas.

But here, Yamaha is making a different sort of thing. These are true
commuter bikes, not just little electric mopeds.

The PES1, below, looks pretty nice:

Yamaha's presser on the Motor show gives a rather breathless
description, without actually providing much info:

All the bikes shown at TMS from Yamaho look pretty cool.

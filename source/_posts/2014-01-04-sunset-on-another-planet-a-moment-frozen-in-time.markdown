## A Moment Frozen in Time

![A&nbsp;moment&nbsp;frozen&nbsp;in&nbsp;time]({{page.image | prepend: site.images.s3path}} "A moment frozen in time.") 

> On May 19th, 2005, NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit captured
  this stunning view as the Sun sank below the rim of Gusev crater on
  Mars. This Panoramic Camera (Pancam) mosaic was taken around 6:07 in
  the evening of the rover's 489th martian day, or sol. Spirit was
  commanded to stay awake briefly after sending that sol's data to the
  Mars Odyssey orbiter just before sunset. This small panorama of the
  western sky was obtained using Pancam's 750-nanometer, 530-nanometer
  and 430-nanometer color filters. This filter combination allows
  false color images to be generated that are similar to what a human
  would see, but with the colors slightly exaggerated. In this image,
  the bluish glow in the sky above the Sun would be visible to us if
  we were there, but an artifact of the Pancam's infrared imaging
  capabilities is that with this filter combination the redness of the
  sky farther from the sunset is exaggerated compared to the daytime
  colors of the martian sky. Because Mars is farther from the Sun than
  the Earth is, the Sun appears only about two-thirds the size that it
  appears in a sunset seen from the Earth. The terrain in the
  foreground is the rock outcrop "Jibsheet," a feature that Spirit has
  been investigating for several weeks (rover tracks are dimly visible
  leading up to "Jibsheet"). The floor of Gusev crater is visible in
  the distance, and the Sun is setting behind the wall of Gusev some
  80 km (50 miles) in the distance.


> This mosaic is yet another example from MER of a beautiful, sublime
  martian scene that also captures some important scientific
  information. Specifically, sunset and twilight images are
  occasionally acquired by the science team to determine how high into
  the atmosphere the martian dust extends, and to look for dust or ice
  clouds. Other images have shown that the twilight glow remains
  visible, but increasingly fainter, for up to two hours before
  sunrise or after sunset. The long martian twilight (compared to
  Earth's) is caused by sunlight scattered around to the night side of
  the planet by abundant high altitude dust. Similar long twilights or
  extra-colorful sunrises and sunsets sometimes occur on Earth when
  tiny dust grains that are erupted from powerful volcanoes scatter
  light high in the atmosphere.

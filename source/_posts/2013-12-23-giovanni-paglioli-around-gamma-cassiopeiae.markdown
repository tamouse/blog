[Giovanni Paglioli][gpalioli] has captured and composited a fantastic
image of the region around Gamma Cassiopeiae:

Giovanni's [explanation on flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/astrojohnny/11483534545/):

> This is the area near Gamma Cassiopeie, including IC59/63 nebulae.

> I was uncertain if to publish this image... Too many different
  datasets at different imagescale and resolution. Some images where a
  little hazy and some others has a certain degree of foggyness and
  haloes. Anyway I finally decided to go.
  
> Main optics (where the most datas comes from) where: Officina
  Stellare UCRC 300 f5.4 and Takahashi Epsilon 210 f3. Cameras used
  mostly: FLI ML11002 and QSI 683WSG8. Mounts; Software Bisque
  Paramount MX and Astro Physics Match1 GTO.
  
> Guiding off axis with a Starlight Xpress Lodestar camera.

> Total integration time is about (LLRGB image type) 240:120:120:120.

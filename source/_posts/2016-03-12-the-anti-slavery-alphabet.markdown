An interesting old book surfaced to my attention, a little late for
Black History Month this year, but still quite relevant: "The
Anti-Slavery Alphabet". Written in 1846 for the Anti-Slavery Faire in
Philidelphia of that year, it's a basic primer for teaching letters
with anti-slavery lessons.

The forward, here:

![{{ page.images[2].name }}]({{ page.images[2].src | prepend: page.s3url }})

reads:

> ## To our little readers.

> Listen, little children, all,
> Listen to our earnest call:
> You are very young, 'tis true,
> But there's much that you can do.
> Even you can plead with men
> That they buy not slaves again,
> And that those they have may be
> Quickly set at liberty.
>
> They may harken what *you* say,
> Though from *us* they turn away.
> Sometimes, when from school you walk,
> You can with your playmates talk,
> Tell them of the slave child's fate,
> Motherless and desolate.
>
> And you can refuse to take
> Candy, sweetmeat, pie or cake,
> Saying "no" -- unless 'tis free --
> "The slave shall not work for me."
>
> Thus, dear little children, each
> May some useful lesson teach;
> Thus each one may help to free
> This fair land from slavery.

## "A is an Abolitionist / B is a Brother"

![{{ page.images[3].name }}]({{ page.images[3].src | prepend: page.s3url }})

> A is an Abolitionist --
> A man who want to free
> The wretched slave -- and give to all
> An equal liberty
>
> B is a Brother with a skin
> Of somewhat darker hue,
> But of our Heavenly Father's sight,
> He is as dear as you
{: style="white-space: pre-line"}

## "K is the Kidnapper / L is the Lash"

![{{ page.images[8].name}}]({{ page.images[8].src | prepend: page.s3url}})

> K is the Kidnapper, who stole
> That little child and mother --
> Shrieking, it clung around her, but
> He tore them from each other.
>
> L is the Lash, that brutally
> He swung around its head
> Threatening that "if it cried again,
> He'd whip it till 'twas dead."
{: style="white-space: pre-line"}

Problematic use of "its" in the second line of the "L" stanza I *believe*
is intentionally showing the de-humanization of slaves, but I don't
think they should have there -- the need at this point is for
*re-humanizing* the person being tortured.

## M is the Merchant of the North / N is the Negro, Rambling Free

![{{ page.images[9].name}}]({{ page.images[9].src | prepend: page.s3url}})

> M is the Merchant of the north,
> Who buys what slaves produce --
> So they are stolen, whipped, and worked,
> For his, **AND FOR OUR USE**
>
> N is the Negro, rambling free
> In his far distant home,
> Delighting 'neath the palm trees' shade
> And cocoa-nut to roam
{: style="white-space: pre-line"}

Emphasis mine, **for we have been complicit.**

Romanticism in the flesh here, about African natives lives and
environment; perhaps as bad as anything else. Perhaps the sentiment
is what's important? Perhaps not.

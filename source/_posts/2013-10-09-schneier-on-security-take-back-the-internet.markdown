Steven Schneier makes a call to arms for the people who build and
maintain the Internet.

> ## Take Back the Internet

> Government and industry have betrayed the
> [Internet](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet), and us.

> By subverting the Internet at every level to make it a vast,
> multi-layered and robust surveillance platform, the NSA has
> undermined a fundamental social contract. The companies that build
> and manage our Internet infrastructure, the companies that create
> and sell us our hardware and software, or the companies that host
> our data: we can no longer trust them to be ethical Internet
> stewards.

> This is not the Internet the world needs, or the Internet its
> creators envisioned. We need to take it back.

> And by we, I mean the engineering community.

> Yes, this is primarily a political problem, a policy matter that
> requires political intervention.

> But this is also an engineering problem, and there are several
> things engineers can -- and should -- do.

> One, we should expose. If you do not have a security clearance, and
> if you have not received a National Security Letter, you are not
> bound by a federal confidentially requirements or a gag order. If
> you have been contacted by the NSA to subvert a product or protocol,
> you need to come forward with your story. Your employer obligations
> don't cover illegal or unethical activity. If you work with
> classified data and are truly brave, expose what you
> know. [We need whistleblowers](https://www.schneier.com/essay-429.html).

> We need to know how exactly how the NSA and other agencies are
> subverting routers, switches, the Internet backbone, encryption
> technologies and cloud systems. I already have five stories from
> people like you, and I've just started collecting. I
> want 50. There's safety in numbers, and this form of civil
> disobedience is the moral thing to do.

> Two, we can design. We need to figure out how to re-engineer the
> Internet to prevent this kind of wholesale spying. We need new
> techniques to prevent communications intermediaries from leaking
> private information.

> We can make surveillance expensive again. In particular, we need
> open protocols, open implementations, open systems -- these will be
> harder for the NSA to subvert.

> The Internet Engineering Task Force, the group that defines the
> standards that make the internet run, has a meeting planned for
> early November in Vancouver. This group needs to dedicate its next
> meeting to this task. This is an emergency, and demands an emergency
> response.

> Three, we can influence governance. I have resisted saying this up
> to now, and I am saddened to say it, but the US has proved to be an
> unethical steward of the Internet. The UK is no better. The NSA's
> actions are legitimizing the internet abuses by China, Russia, Iran
> and others. We need to figure out new means of internet governance,
> ones that makes it harder for powerful tech countries to monitor
> everything. For example, we need to demand
> [transparency, oversight, and accountability](https://www.schneier.com/essay-435.html)
> from our governments and corporations.

> Unfortunately, this is going play directly into the hands of
> totalitarian governments that want to control their country's
> Internet for even more extreme forms of surveillance. We need to
> figure out how to prevent that, too. We need to avoid the mistakes
> of the International Telecommunications Union, which has become a
> forum to legitimize bad government behavior, and create truly
> international governance that can't be dominated or abused by any
> one country.

> Generations from now, when people look back on these early decades
> of the Internet, I hope they will not be disappointed in us. We can
> ensure that they don't only if each of us makes this a priority, and
> engages in the debate. We have a
> [moral duty](http://wikileaks.org/Statement-by-Edward-Snowden-to.html)
> to do this, and we have no time to lose.

> Dismantling the surveillance state won't be easy. Has any country
> that engaged in mass surveillance of its own citizens voluntarily
> given up that capability? Has any mass surveillance country avoided
> becoming totalitarian? Whatever happens, we're going to be breaking
> new ground.

> Again, the politics of this is a bigger task than the engineering,
> but the engineering is critical. We need to demand that real
> technologists be involved in any key government decision making on
> these issues. We've had enough of lawyers and politicians not fully
> understanding technology; we need technologists at the table when we
> build tech policy.

> To the engineers, I say this: we built the Internet, and some of us
> have helped to subvert it. Now, those of us who love liberty have to
> fix it.

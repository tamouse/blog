Story of a baby squirrel found nearly frozen, but revived and nursed to health by a kind redditor.

He Was Found Freezing And Dying. Yet Somehow The Last Photo Made My Entire Year.
================================================================================

[original](http://www.viralnova.com/found-freezing/)

When [one man](http://www.reddit.com/user/iamcleverhoneybadger) found a
small squirrel freezing in the cold, he knew he just couldn’t let him
stay out in the elements on his own. So, he scooped the little guy up,
took him home and took part in the most adorable recovery process the
Internet has ever seen. (Seriously, try to *not* squeal when you see
these pictures.)

The baby squirrel was curled up, wasn’t moving and was freezing in the
cold.

The hero immediately scooped him up and put him in the nice, glove-lined
cup holder inside of his car.

Little squirrel, now out of the elements, had a cozy home.

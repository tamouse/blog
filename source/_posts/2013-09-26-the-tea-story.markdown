A Zen story/koan about keeping room in your cup.

_A famous Zen teaching story._

One day, the teacher Nan-in was visited by a famous intellectual.

Nan-in was admired for his wisdom, his prudence and the simplicity of
his life. He accepted in silence that some men were sitting with him
in the evening, but they should not bother him after meditation. Then,
he seemed serious and even grim, but it wasn't more than needed
rehabilitation while working in his garden, peeling potatoes or
mending clothes.

When the prestigious intellectual arrived, he announced he didn't have
much time because he had to return to his duties at the university.

He greeted the Teacher and, without more introductions, he asked  him
for the Zen. Nan-in offered him the tea and served it with all the
calm of the world. And although the cup of the visitor was already
full, the Teacher continued pouring it. The intellectual watched the
overflow until he no longer could restrain himself.

&ldquo;It is overfull. No more will go in!&rdquo;

&ldquo;Like this cup,&rdquo; Nan-in responded without losing the
composure nor leaving his amiable smile, &ldquo;you are full of your
own opinions and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first
empty your cup?&rdquo;

Angry, the intellectual rose and, with a mere inclination of head, he
took leave without saying a word. While Teacher picked up the pieces
of porcelain and cleaned the ground, a young person approached to help
him.

&ldquo;Oh, Teacher, how much sufficiency! How difficult it must be for
the intellectuals to understand the simplicity of the Zen&rdquo;.

&ldquo;Not less than for many young people who arrive loaded with
ambition and they have not strived to cultivate the disciplines of the
study. At least, the intellectuals have already made part of the way
and have something to let go&rdquo;.

&ldquo;Then, Teacher, what is the correct attitude?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Not to judge, and to remain kind&rdquo;.

From [Laughing Squid](https://laughingsquid.com/) comes a report of an invention of a [Rube Goldberg-type machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine) with "invisible glass". Coolest thing I've seen today.

TL;DR: (spoiler): they use an oil that has the same refractive properties as glass to make the glass inserted in the oil to "disapear" -- since they are the same refractive index, light does not bend around the glass, so no edges become visible. Pretty cool!

**Explanation:** The faint and somehow menacing cometary globule CG4
reaches through the center of [this deep southern
skyscape](http://www.astrophoton.com/cg04.htm). About 1,300 light-years
from Earth toward the constellation Puppis, its head is about 1.5
light-years in diameter and its tail about 8 light-years long. That's
far larger than the Solar System's comets that it seems to resemble. [In
fact, the dusty cloud](http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.1180) contains enough
material to form several Sun-like stars and likely has ongoing star
formation within. How its distinctive form came about is still debated,
but its long tail trails away from the [Vela Supernova
remnant](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150101.html) near the center of the
Gum Nebula, while its head could represent the rupture of an originally
more spherical cloud. Still, the edge-on spiral galaxy also near picture
center is not actually being [threatened by
CG4](http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1503/). The galaxy lies in the
distant background more than 100 million [light-years
away](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandworm_%28Dune%29).

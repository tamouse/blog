Very strange sculpture indeed.

> In the rush to get to the main attraction–the 17-foot Renaissance
> masterpiece David–many visitors to the Accademia in Florence walk
> right by the gallery's other Michelangelos. Lining the walls there
> are four of the artist's so-called
> “[slave sculptures](http://ahuskofmeaning.com/2011/08/michelangelo-at-the-accademia-part-2-the-unfinished-slaves/),”
> works intended for the tomb of Pope Julius II that the artist never
> quite got around to finishing. In these, bodies emerge half-formed
> from rough blocks of marble–a Renaissance master's process frozen in
> time. Peter Marigold had these in mind when he was making his
> “[Roughed Out Soldiers](http://www.petermarigold.com/Roughed%20Out%20Soldiers.htm),”
> and they offer the same sense of raw material being chipped away
> into a familiar form. But there's one big difference: With his
> soldiers, Marigold's totally faking it. 

> What you're seeing, in a sense, is a sculpture in reverse.

> At first glance, it looks like these pictures capture the creation
> of a standard toy soldier, showing his journey from a
> brightly-colored chunk of plastic to a miniature serviceman step by
> step. After a second or two, though, you'll catch yourself: Wait,
> they don't sculpt those things, do they? And you'll be right–they
> don't. It's a bit of a trick. Marigold started with the soldiers
> and, mold by mold, turned them into something totally
> unrecognizable. 

> The plastic pieces were created for *Blanks in Between*, an
> exhibition by the
> [Workshop for Potential Design](http://www.workshopforpotentialdesign.com/). On
> his site, Marigold explains the process: “A rubber mould was made of
> a toy soldier. The mould is then excavated and recast in
> plastic. The excavation continues and each subsequent layer is cast
> again and again in sequence until the humanoid form is reduced to an
> amorphous blob.” What you're seeing, in a sense, is a sculpture in
> reverse. Or, as Marigold puts it, a record of the soldiers “being
> consumed by the mould they were born from.”

> Lining the pieces up the way he did, from left to right, with the
> rough forms evolving into the familiar ones in a sort of plastic
> March of Progress, was done with the intention of generating a bit
> of dissonance for the viewer. It's an effort to play with our
> expectations of a mass produced product. “I've actually left many
> things ambiguous in the project,” he explains. “At a glance it might
> seem to someone that the blobs are transforming into the more
> familiar soldiers, but it's the other way round.” The colors, too,
> were picked for dissonance–the more accurate casts got the least
> pigment, and thus the least mass-produced look, while the amorphous
> blobs, which were in fact the most handmade, got bright, synthetic,
> assembly-line hues. 

> The re-molded objects are fascinating on their own–it's like those
> recognizable humanoid forms are gradually calcified with geode-like
> growth. But even in trying to introduce some procedural randomness
> to these icons of the injection-molded era, Marigold got just the
> results he was looking for. “The pieces are very chaotic, but I must
> admit, they look exactly as I had imagined from the moment I started
> the project.”

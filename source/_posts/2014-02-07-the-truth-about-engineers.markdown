While this is pretty obviously Dilbert's team purposely derailing the PHB's lousy attempt to be like Jeff Bezos, when you encounter this in real life, it's quite often how engineers work out solutions to problems. The intent isn't to derail or kill the idea, it's to explore ways it can be met, possible obstacles that need to be overcome, and so on.

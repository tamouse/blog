## Let me repeat part of that:

> # "We will never have our flames extinguished by knowledge"

Knowledge does not put out our fire.

Complacency in thinking your knowledge is enough is what puts out our
fire.

Curiousity fuels our
fire. For those of us that seek, that question, knowledge is the
fertile ground in which formulate new questions.

Answers that cease or stop further inquiry are not knowledge;
they are camouflage, salves, blinders, and propaganda to make us
silent and to curtail learning and seeking. Accept nothing, question
everything, including *this*.

**Summary Author**: [Chris Kotsiopoulos](mailto:chriskots-at-gmail-dot-com)

> This 70-shot photo sequence shows a [lightning](http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/natural-%20%20%20%20disasters/lightning-profile.html) display that occurred during a [severe thunderstorm](http://www.bom.gov.au/info/thunder/#definition) last summer on the island of [Ikaria](http://epod.usra.edu/blog/2011/08/lightning-and-lunar-eclipse.html%20), Greece, near the southwestern coast of Turkey. The stormy weather actually developed during my photo session of the [total lunar eclipse on June 15, 2011](http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/OH/OH2011.html#LE2011Jun15T) (see related link below). To make this shot, I set my camera on a tripod taking 20-second exposures continuously. More than 100 lightning bolts were captured in this sequence, the majority of which were potent [cloud-to-ground](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/earth/lightning-types.html) strikes.

**Photo details**: Canon EOS 550D camera; shutter speed of 20 seconds (70 shots); 7.1 aperture; ISO 400;Â  Canon EF 50mm, f/1.8 II lens; 50.0 mm focal length. Photo sequence taken on June 16, 2011 between 1:17 a.m. and 2:40 a.m.

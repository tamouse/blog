The story of how Hubble scientists turned the telescope on a
completely dark area of sky, not once, but twice, and the discovery
that not only was that area *not* dark, but was *full* of *galaxies*
-- yes galaxies, not just stars. The video is amazing.

> planets. As images from Hubble are in constant demand, the worry was
> that devoting so much time to a black space would prove futile. Once the
> photons finally registered, though, that leap of faith proved fruitful:
> light from over three thousand galaxies illuminated the image. A few
> years and missions later, Hubble’s glimpse into what is known as the
> deep field has revealed that we are just one tiny part of a vast system
> comprising 100 billion galaxies.

> **In today’s increasingly gluten free world, bread is getting a bad
rap.**

> But whether or not you can tolerate gluten, you can allow these
bread lamps to illuminate your home. Japanese designer and foodie,
Yukiko Morita has created lamps out of real loaves of bread. Aside from
the basic flour, salt, and yeast, her loaves also have an LED light and
batteries inside.

> The 27 year old artist calls her line Pampshade which combines the
Japanese word for bread (Pan) with lamp shade. She got the idea for
Pampshade lights when she was working at a small bakery in Kyoto and
noticed the way sunlight shone through a hollowed out French baguette.
After trial and error with over 300 prototypes using the leftovers from
the bakery each day, she discovered that hollowing out the bread and
drying the shell in the oven gives the best results. She coats the baked
shell in resin and inserts the light bulb.

> Morita’s Pampshades were on display at Tokyo Design Week. The lamps
retail for \$30-\$50. Allow your favorite shape of bread to light up
your kitchen by shopping on [her website.](http://pampshade.com/) You

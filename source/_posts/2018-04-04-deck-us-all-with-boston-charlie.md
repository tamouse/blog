This is a blast from the past! Walt Kelly's Pogo comic strip was a big
staple in my family growing up, and we sung this with much gusto at
any old time of year.



Deck us all with Boston Charlie, <br />
Walla walla, Wash., an' Kalamazoo! <br />
Nora's freezin' on the trolley, <br />
Swaller dollar cauliflower alley'garoo!

Don't we know archaic barrel, <br />
Lullaby lilla boy, Louisville Lou? <br />
Trolley Molly don't loue Harold, <br />
Boola boola Pensacoola hullabaloo!

Bark us all bow-wows of folly, <br />
Polly wolly cracker n'too-da-loo! <br />
Donkey Bonny brays a carol, <br />
Antelope Cantaloup, 'lope with you!

Hunky Dory's pop is lolly gaggin' on the wagon, <br />
Willy, folly go through! <br />
Chollie's collie barks at Barrow, <br />
Harum scarum five alarum bung-a-loo!

Duck us all in bowls of barley, <br />
Hinky dinky dink an' poIly voo! <br />
Chilly Filly's name is Chollie, <br />
Chollie Filly's jolly chilly view halloo!

Bark us all bow-wows of folly, <br />
Double-bubble, toyland trouble! Woof, Woof, Woof! <br />
Tizzy seas on melon collie! <br />
Dibble-dabble, scribble-scrabble! Goof, Goof, Goof!

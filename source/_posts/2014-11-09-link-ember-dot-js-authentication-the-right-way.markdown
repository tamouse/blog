Good article on setting token authorization in Ember.JS: [{{ page.title }}]({{ page.source }})

I haven't looked at Ember.JS yet, but the issue of authorizing API usage is a common one across various platforms and frameworks. It's a little surprising something like [Devise][devise] for Rails hasn't emerged, but maybe that due to the plethora of JS frameworks. Still, the concepts here seem quite applicable when translated to other framework idioms.

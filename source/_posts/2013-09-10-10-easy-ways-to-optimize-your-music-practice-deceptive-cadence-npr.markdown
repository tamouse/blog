> 
> Last summer, we published a week-long series called ["The Young Person's Guide to Making Music"](http://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/155272002/the-young-persons-guide-to-making-music)
> in collaboration with our colleagues at the radio program [*From The Top*.](http://www.fromthetop.org/) The idea was to provide guidance and
> suggestions for parents and kids just starting out in music, with ideas
> for everything from finding a great teacher to reducing audition
> anxiety.
> 
> The piece in that series that struck the biggest chord (har, har) was
> titled ["Getting Kids to Practice Music — Without Tears Or Tantrums"](http://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2012/06/18/155282684/getting-kids-to-practice-music-without-tears-or-tantrums);
> it's been one of our most popular posts all year. And we promised
> ourselves that we'd circle back to the topic of how to practice
> effectively around the time of a new school year. But these tips are
> effective for anyone who plays an instrument or sings.
> 
> 1.  **Find somewhere quiet.** This seems too obvious for words, but not
>     only will you be far less likely to succumb to all sorts of
>     distractions, but entering a special practice area, whether it's a
>     certain room or just a corner of the living room, will help prepare
>     you mentally for this very particular kind of work. Mindful
>     intention is everything, and having the ritual of going to the same
>     place every time can help set that intention.
> 2.  **Have your supplies nearby.** I really love cellist David Finckel's
>     ["Cello Talks"](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAE1ED06AB33DF65D)
>     100-video series on YouTube; you don't have to play cello to get a
>     lot out of many of them. Some of what he covers seems like
>     impossibly basic advice — as in the discussion (below) of his
>     practice space. Part of his advice is to keep a pencil sharpener and
>     a very clean eraser within arm's reach, along with a pencil to mark
>     up your music. Simple, right? But those little things are easy to
>     forget, and if you have to go searching for them, add up to a big
>     waste of time.
> 3.  **Technology can be an amazing aid** — as long as you don't spend
>     too much time futzing with it. Three free or low-cost apps I have on
>     my phone and iPad: a metronome, a tuner and a timer, which are all
>     essential tools for practicing. And I always have my phone with me
>     (see above).
> 4.  **Begin with the end in mind: Have a goal for each practice session
>     before you start playing.** Just playing through your music isn't the
>     same thing as practicing. Before you start, think: What do I want
>     to accomplish today? If you're not sure what you need to focus on,
>     ask your teacher for a few concrete goals to work toward before the
>     next lesson — and write them down so that you can refer to them
>     during your practice sessions.
> 5.  **Map a practice session out like a workout.** Lots of musicians
>     start with a few actual stretches and breathing exercises before
>     they pick up their instruments. Even if you don't go quite that far,
>     a pretty common scenario is to start with scales as a warm-up, to
>     loosen up your muscles and get your brain thinking about technique;
>     move on to the "working" part where you analyze and try to solve
>     problems; then cool down by improvising or revisiting some music you
>     already know well.
> 6.  **Practice smarter, not necessarily longer.** You'll probably
>     accomplish a whole lot more in a short amount of time if you have a
>     very focused objective — and science tells us that we have a
>     [limited amount of willpower](http://www.npr.org/2011/09/18/140516974/resistance-training-for-your-willpower-muscles)
>     to draw upon anyway. So make the most of the time you have. Say you
>     are having trouble with two very tricky measures. Set your timer for
>     a short period (like five or 10 minutes), and then work just on one
>     problem in as many ways as you can — break it down into even smaller
>     and more manageable bits, go super slow, try to play the passage
>     backwards, change the rhythm, whatever. If that trouble spot is
>     still giving you *agita*, then make yourself a mental note to come
>     back to that section again tomorrow. Chances are it will be much,
>     much easier the next time around.
> 7.  **Don't always start at the beginning every time.** Remember what I
>     said about maximizing your time and your willpower? This. It can
>     feel really good to hear yourself playing the beginning of a piece
>     beautifully, but you may wind up wasting the limited time and energy
>     you have. (Also, it leads to performances that start strong and
>     then, well, wilt.)
> 8.  **Challenge yourself — physically.** Especially if you're trying to
>     wrestle down an element that you find problematic, scientific
>     researchers say that if you add a physical challenge to the
>     difficult task, such as trying to play that part while standing on
>     one leg or while walking, your brain is likely to start carving out
>     new neural pathways — and the original task will be easier when you
>     return to just doing that.
> 9.  **Practice away from your instrument.**Many musicians use
>     visualization in the same way that athletes do: They run through
>     their music without touching their instruments. Try bringing your
>     music along with you (either on paper or a mobile device) when you
>     know you'll have some downtime, such as during a car or train ride,
>     and read through the piece silently.
> 10. **Reward hard work — in positive ways — to help your brain automate
>     good habits.** That sounds like out-and-out bribery, but again,
>     science! Finding something that your brain likes helps it remember
>     the "[habit loop](http://www.npr.org/2012/03/05/147192599/habits-how-they-form-and-how-to-break-them),"
>     writes Charles Duhigg, author of *The Power of Habit*.

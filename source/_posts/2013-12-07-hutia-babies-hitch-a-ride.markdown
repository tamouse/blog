> # [Hutia Babies Hitch a Ride](http://www.zooborns.com/zooborns/2013/12/hutia-babies-hitch-a-ride.html)
> 
> Riding on the back of their mother, three Cuban Hutia babies born
> November 7 are charming visitors at [Munich Zoo
> Hellabrunn](http://www.tierpark-hellabrunn.de/muenchner-tierpark-hellabrunn-der-zoo-der-stadt-muenchen.html).
> 
> When theyâ€™re not hitching a ride, the mouse-sized babies snuggle up with
> mom and peek at the Agoutis and Parrots that share their enclosure.  The
> babies have been named Nikita, Nicki and Nicol.

> The triplets are the first of their species to be born at the zoo in 12
> years.  Five-year-old Fidel, the father, was introduced to female Morena
> last year. 
> 
> Morena and Fidel will look after Nikita, Nicki and Nicol for about six
> months and teach them how to climb and groom each other.
> 
> As their name implies, Cuban Hutia are found on the island of Cuba. 
> They are small herbivorous rodents, similar to Cavies.  Hutia are active
> during the day and are very social animals; thanks to their strong claws
> they are excellent climbers and diggers. About 20 species of Hutia once
> lived on various Caribbean islands; seven species are extinct, with the
> remaining species listed as Threatened by the International Union for
> Conservation of Nature.

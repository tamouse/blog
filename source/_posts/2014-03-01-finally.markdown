At last, relief is in sight.

This has been such a hard winter, for me and others. The past couple of weeks, since the last huge storm, the streets have been undrivable because of the "bullet-proof" ice making holes and ruts, and being slippery as glass. So many times I've been going along at about 3-5 miles per hour and just feeling out of control. It's also been this aching, aching cold that has everything hurting.

I will be so glad when this is over. I hope to be gone far, far from Minnesota by next winter.

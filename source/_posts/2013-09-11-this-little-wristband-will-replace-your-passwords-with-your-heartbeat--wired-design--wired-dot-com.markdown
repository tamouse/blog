The Nymi is a little plastic wristband that uses your hearbeat as a
password.

> Martin an his team have created the Nymi, a plastic wristband that is
> aiming to be the common thread that connects your identity to the smart
> devices of the future. Born out of research done at the University of
> Toronto, the device uses a biometric sensor to authenticate identity
> through a person’s unique electrocardiogram. Which is a fancy way of
> saying, the pattern of your heartbeat could be your new set of keys.
> 
> The Bionym team found a way to extract features of your heartbeat that
> allows them to create a robust biometric template. So if you get nervous
> and your heart speeds up or you just ran a few miles, the waveform of
> your heartbeat might appear more condensed, but it’s still essentially
> the same pattern. The idea is that users will strap on the Nymi each
> morning, touch the topside sensor to read their ECG and will be
> constantly authenticated until they decide to take it off.
> 
> Other devices like the NFC Ring and Motorola’s Skip are using near field
> communication technology to do away with passwords and make the world
> more wirelessly connected, but they don’t really take the individual
> into account. Those devices are essentially like high-tech keys that if
> lost, could theoretically be used by whoever found it.
> 
> The Nymi’s biggest advantage (and biggest risk) is that it uses
> biometrics to validate a user’s identity. This puts the Nymi in a
> position to make personalization and identity more easily accessible
> than ever before, but it also carries a massive responsibility for
> protecting privacy. The band won’t work unless it detects your specific
> ECG, so depending on how you intend to use it, it needs to be around
> your wrist all day long. This allows for persistent authentication,
> meaning you don’t have to continually touch a pad to register your
> fingerprint or swipe a ring to open your front door. Depending on the
> proximity determined by developers, you simply have to walk into a room
> to engage with devices or apps. “If your identity is being used to
> provide a personalized experience, the value of that is that you don’t
> have to think about it,” Martin says. “If you had to enter things every
> time, that’s not as valuable.”
> 
> Martin believes the interactions between people and technology should be
> passive, but not absent.
> 
> Of course, wearing something all day every day is a lot to ask,
> particularly because no one has gotten wearable technology quite right.
> The Nymi looks a lot like the fitness trackers on the market: a
> relatively inconspicuous rubber wristband with a sensor on the wrist and
> at the top. Though it doesn’t scream “Look! Technology!” it’s certainly
> not invisible. Bionym is toying with the form factor and has considered
> making the Nymi into a necklace or embeddable into clothing. One thing
> they’re not doing, is following the shiny smart watch trend. “You have
> to think, ‘Well, what is it people are willing to accept?’” Martin says.
> “There’s been so much talk about smart watches and how they’re the next
> big thing, but nobody’s really justified why somebody would want to put
> a big screen on their wrist. We’re following the philosophy that
> wearable tech is less about the digital interaction with the user and
> more about technology that melts into the background.”
> 
> Martin believes the interactions between people and technology should be
> passive, but not altogether absent. The most recent version of the Nymi
> will communicate with users by little vibrations that let them know
> their identity is being used or that the band is talking to other
> devices. “The idea is that users want some awareness and it can be
> really subtle,” he says. “But it goes toward this assurance of privacy
> and security and this idea that it’s not doing things without you
> knowing it.”

> Privacy is a big concern for the Nymi, and you can imagine the company
> is going to encounter some serious questions about the security of
> wearing your biometric identity around your wrist. Typed passwords and
> pin numbers can be discarded and easily changed, but if your ECG gets
> into the wrong hands, that’s a big problem since you can’t exactly reset
> your heartbeat. Martin says the Nymi was conceived with the idea of
> “privacy by design,” which is basically Bionym’s policy of building a
> product that’s rooted in keeping data protected. “There’s going to be
> major pushback if users feel their privacy isn’t protected,” admits
> Martin.
> 
> The wristband uses a cryptographic chip, which means all data is
> encrypted at the hardware level. And Martin says it’s impossible for
>  anyone to trace the signal emitting from the wrist band back to the
> user unless people opt-in to allow that access (the default setting is
> opt-out).”Whenever there’s a new technology that people don’t
> necessarily understand, there’s always going to be a backlash and fear,”
> he says. ”It’s not immediately obvious, but this product is actually a
> way for people to improve their privacy and take more control over their
> information.”
> 
> You can pre-order the Nymi for \$79, but it’s not going into production
> until spring of 2014. In the months leading up to the official launch,
> Bionym’s main task is getting third-party developers on board to create
> a thriving ecosystem of apps and devices that the Nymi can be used with.
> Proving the Nymi’s value to other companies is the first step to this
> new technology being adopted by the larger public. “There’s almost a
> chicken and egg thing here,” Martin says. “You need a lot of people
> [users] on board to make it justifiable for others to want to integrate,
> and for people to want to get on board, they want to know that there’s a
> lot of integration and that it will do a lot of things for them.”

> > The first pair is expected to sell for $150,000 (Â£97,600) the
> > equivalent cost of 20 standard wheelchairs.

> > The inventors claim that due to the upright and mobile nature of their

> > infections that can come with wheelchair use.*
> 
> One of the great features of this design, as you can see in the video,
> is that it's fairly easy for a wheelchair user to mount the exoskeleton

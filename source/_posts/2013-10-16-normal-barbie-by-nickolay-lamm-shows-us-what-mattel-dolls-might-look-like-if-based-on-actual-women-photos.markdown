> "If we criticize skinny models, we should at least be open to the
  possibility that Barbie may negatively influence young girls as
  well," Lamm said in an email to the Huffington Post. "Furthermore, a
  realistically proportioned Barbie actually looks pretty good."

> Considering how peculiar a [Barbie body would look in real
  life](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/10/barbie-body-real-life-infographic_n_3057690.html),
  Lamm concluded: "If there's even a small chance of Barbie in its
  present form negatively influencing girls, and if Barbie looks good
  as an average-sized woman in America, what's stopping Mattel from
  making one?"

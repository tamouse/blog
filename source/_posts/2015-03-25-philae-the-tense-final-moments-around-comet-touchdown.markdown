The mission to land Philae on  Comet 67P did not happen overnight, we
all know that. It was 20 years in the making, and stretched the
imaginations, fortitude, and luck. In this video, Stephan Ulamec, the
Philae lander program manager, it was a tense, tense time, when you
see the end of 20 years work approaching rapidly, made even more tense
because of the cameras trained on you and your team.

Thank you to people like Mr. Ulamec and the Philae and Rosetta teams
at ESA. Truly a remarkable event, even if things didn't go as planned,
things went, and you did the incredible.

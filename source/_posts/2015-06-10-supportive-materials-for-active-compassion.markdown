The
[Foundation for Active Compassion](http://foundationforactivecompassion.org/)
provides some very wonderful material for guided meditaion. My
counselor recently attended a workshop on Compassion and we went
through the audio
[Identifying Benefactor Moments and Receiving Love: Guided Meditation](http://foundationforactivecompassion.org/images/audio/IdentifyingBenefactors.mp3)
(mp3 download, approximately 14 minutes guided meditaion). It was
really a wonderful sit.

One of the great take-aways at the time is the phrase:

> "May this one have deepest well-being, happiness, and joy"

which encapulates the lovingkindenss metta so neatly.

I'm trying to make time to listen to this every morning.

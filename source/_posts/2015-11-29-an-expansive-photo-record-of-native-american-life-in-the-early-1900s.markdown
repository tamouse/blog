From mashable.com, a photo essay on the North American Indian, from
1904 to 1924. An incredible photo record of life of Native Americans.

> Born on a Wisconsin farm in 1868, Edward Sheriff Curtis grew up to
become a commercial photographer in Seattle. In 1895 he photographed
Princess Angeline, the daughter of the Duwamish chief Seattle, for
whom the city was named.

> That encounter sparked Curtis' lifelong fascination with the cultures
and lives of Native American tribes. He soon joined expeditions to
visit tribes in Alaska and Montana.

> In 1906, Curtis was approached by wealthy financier J.P. Morgan, who
was interested in funding a documentary project on the indigenous
people of the continent. They conceived a 20-volume series, called The
North American Indian.

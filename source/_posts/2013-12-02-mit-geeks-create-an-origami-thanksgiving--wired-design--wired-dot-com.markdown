> In theory, Origami is simple: Take a sheet of paper, follow the
> dotted lines and without the use of scissors or glue, you've got a
> paper crane. It stands to reason that if you're good at following
> instructions, you're good at origami. And that's true—anyone can
> fold their way to a simple paper crane. But truly grasping the
> geometric complexities of that crane? That's actually pretty brainy
> stuff. 

> Origami is arguably more math than art, so it makes sense then that
> MIT would have a thriving origami scene. Every Sunday, a group of
> around 20 to 30 people gather on campus to experiment with paper
> folding techniques. Most recently, the group folded a series of
> turkeys, cornucopias, pine cones and vegetables to create a
> gorgeously nerdy Thanksgiving tableau. 

> If you're not a math person, it might seem incomprehensible to
> fashion a turkey out of a single piece of paper, but for Yongquan Lu
> and his fellow OrigaMIT members, it's an entertaining challenge. Lu,
> a sophomore mathematics major at MIT, is the incoming president of
> of OrigaMIT, and has been practicing paper folding since high
> school. “I really love how systematic origami is,” he says. “It's
> the perfect combination of math and art.”

> Every origami model you see relies on a blueprint—a series of
> pre-determined creases that will guide the folder through the
> process. In the beginning, precise, careful folding can get you
> pretty far, but if you want to start riffing on designs or creating
> your own, you have to have more than an elementary grasp on some
> basic mathematical principles. “I got more involved in investigating
> the connections between math and geometry behind it,” he
> says. “These days a lot of the stuff I fold is a lot more geometric,
> more tessellations.” For the Thanksgiving scene, Lu contributed the
> cornucopia basket, which he nonchalantly describes as a “pretty
> well-known conical, flat tessellation pattern.”

> Most of the students at MIT approach paper folding with a
> highly-technical slant. It's not uncommon for the group to have a
> lengthy discussion about reverse-engineering each of the diagram's
> folds or talk about polyhedral shapes and hexagonal symmetry. “We'll
> ask ourselves, ‘Ok, where does this step come from, why does a
> designer choose to do it like this? Or I wonder if I started with
> these proportions, what would happen?” Lu explains. “That really
> comes out of the engineering background of a lot of our members.”

> Lu is quick to clarify that though OrigaMIT probably tends to be
> slightly more math-centric than your typical origami club, you don't
> need to possess *A Beautiful Mind*-caliber math skills to join
> in. Sure, the peacock-like turkey took more than three hours to
> fold, but if you look around, there are tons of simple yet beautiful
> contributions like the vegetables, leaves and pine cones. “We wanted
> to show that there are models of varying complexities. Sometimes
> people get intimidated because they think we're folding all of these
> complex models,” he says. “But actually everyone can get
> involved—it's not something that's exclusive and insular in any
> way.”

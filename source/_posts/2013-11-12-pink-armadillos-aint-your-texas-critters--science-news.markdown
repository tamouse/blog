> It's a real animal, the smallest armadillo species in the world. At
> about 100 grams, it would fit in your hands. It's covered with “very
> fine, silky white hair,” says Mariella Superina of the CONICET
> research center in Mendoza, Argentina. And its hard outer covering,
> rich in blood vessels, can blush pink.

> Full details of *Chlamyphorus truncatus* biology, though, might as
> well be a fairy tale. It's known only from a dry, sandy swath of
> Argentina and spends most of its time underground. The pink fairy is
> so hard to spot that Superina and her colleagues are struggling to
> determine whether it's endangered or not. She heads an international
> group of specialists now trying to assess the risk of extinction for
> the world's 21 known armadillo species, plus their close relatives,
> the sloths and anteaters.

> In 10 years of field work, she has never caught sight of the pink
> species in the wild. She has seen tracks made by digging claws and
> the diamond-shaped tip of its tail. After several meters, the tracks
> just stop where, she presumes, the armadillo disappeared
> underground. Locals, she says, “can track down any animal — except
> the pink fairy armadillo.” Occasionally someone captures one and
> soon panics about keeping it alive. These rare captives, she
> reports, usually live no more than about eight days.

> Superina struggled to care for one such stray that couldn't be
> returned to the wild. In 2011, she published a*Zoo Biology* paper
> largely about what it wouldn't eat. In desperation, she discovered
> that it would slurp up a goop (consisting of milk, cat food and
> exactly half a banana) that had been mixed for a different
> species. The next stray fairy, though, wouldn't touch the
> stuff. (Don't even think of getting one as a pet, she says.)

> During the eight months the goop-tolerant fairy lived in Superina's
> home terrarium, infrared cameras recorded it moving below the sand
> surface. Biologists had thought the species “swims” through
> sand. No, Superina now says. “It was very funny — it digs and then
> it backs up and compacts the sand with its butt plate.” The video
> shows a pale, furry body digging and butting, digging and
> butting. The flattened round rear plate used in compaction is unique
> to fairy armadillos.

> This rare glimpse may have solved a paleontological mystery, too:
> Previously found rows of compacted earth discs that look like
> slumping sliced bread may actually be the work of ancient fairy
> armadillos' butt plates.

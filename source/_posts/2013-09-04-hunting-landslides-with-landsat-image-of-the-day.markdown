> If a [landslide](http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/154157/) occurs in
> a remote mountain range but nobody sees or hears it, does it matter?
> Unequivocally yes, says Columbia University geophysicist and landslide
> specialist [Colin Stark.](http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/user/cstark) Even
> when they occur in remote areas, large landslides can dam rivers and
> lead to
> [devastating](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=78293)
> downstream floods.“It’s especially critical that we monitor
> ‘catastrophic’ landslides—fast-moving slides that involve more than a
> million tons of debris,” Stark says. “These are the most dangerous
> landslides, but they often go undetected.”
> 
> Stark is working to change that. Along with colleague Göran Ekström, he
> has pioneered a new method to detect landslides by analyzing
> [seismic](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/glossary/?term=seismic%20wave)
> waves—the vibrations that radiate through Earth’s crust because of
> sudden movements of rock, ice, magma, or debris. Stark and his
> colleagues used the technique to locate the landslide shown in the
> satellite images above.
> 
> Automated earthquake detection systems are tuned to monitor intense,
> “short-period” waves produced by sudden slips along
> [tectonic](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/glossary/?term=tectonic)
> faults. Landslides produce seismic waves as well, though their
> short-period signal is weak. Instead, they make powerful long-period
> waves that are sometimes detectable at great distances.
> 
> Stark and Ekström are developing a computer algorithm to scan
> seismographic data specifically for the long-period waves associated
> with landslides. They started by applying their technique to historical
> data. As the pair detailed in a
> [study](ttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1232887) published in Science,
> their approach detected about 29 large landslides that occurred between
> 1980 and 2012 that did not register on standard earthquake-monitoring
> systems.
> 
> In July 2013, Stark and Ekström—with help from Columbia University
> colleague Clément Hilbert—had an opportunity to test their technique in
> real time. On July 25, Stark noted a possible landslide event in
> southeastern Alaska. His initial analysis of the seismic data suggested
> the slide occurred in eastern Alaska and had a mass of about 20 million
> metric tonnes (22 million tons). However, seismic data alone could not
> tell the researchers exactly where the slide had occurred, only that it
> happened within a 25 square-kilometer (10 square-mile) area in the
> Wrangell Mountains.
> 
> That’s where satellites proved critical. When Stark informed the NASA
> Earth Observatory about the possibility of a slide, EO staff checked the
> imagery acquired by the [Operational Land
> Imager](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/landsat/main/LDCM_OLI_intro.html)
> (OLI) on NASA’s [Landsat
> 8](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/landsat/main/index.html) satellite.
> Within a few days, they located the slide.
> 
> The landslide occurred in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park at 61.978°
> North latitude and 143.168° West longitude. Since the landslide is
> difficult to make out in the true-color OLI image below, the location
> has been highlighted in yellow. Click on the image to see how the
> landslide looks without yellow highlighting.

> With the location pinned down, Stark requested the acquisition of the

> The upper image shows the end of a [small
> glacier,](http://goo.gl/maps/MNreK) east of Mount Jarvis, on July 24,
> 2013, about 13 hours before the landslide. Note the tension cracks on
> the south-facing side of the valley wall—a sign the slope was on the
> verge of collapse.
> 
> The second image shows the same area after the landslide on August 13,
> 2013. Debris had tumbled down the valley wall, blanketed the end of the
> glacier, deflected off the far wall of the valley, and tumbled down the
> valley toward Nabesna Glacier to the southeast. A stream of glacial melt
> water was pooling; it should eventually carve a new channel through the
> debris.
> 
> What triggered the slope to fail? Stark suspects that an unusual summer
> heat wave in southern Alaska in summer 2013 played a role. “Most of the
> big landslides that I've worked on in Alaska from 1999 to now have been
> south-facing, summer-time failures,” he says. “My suspicion is that this
> landslide was probably caused by sustained daytime warming and
> progressive melting of rock permafrost.”

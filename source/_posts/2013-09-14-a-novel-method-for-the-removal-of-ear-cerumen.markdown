> We describe the off-label use of a recreational device (the Super Soaker
> Max-D 5000) in the alleviation of a socially emergent ear condition.
>
> A 45-year-old male complained of a profound reduction in his left ear
> acuity while staying at an island cottage in rural Ontario. His hearing
> loss was reducing his ability to hear his newborn son cry in the middle
> of the night, requiring his wife to carry out all late-night child care.
> As a result, correction of the problem was considered urgent.
>
> The patient had been swimming multiple times a day for 6 days. He had
> had several ear infections as a child but was otherwise well. He
> admitted having used a Q-tip in his ear “once or twice” recently in the
> affected ear.
>
> An otoscope being available, examination of the external ears was
> conducted. The nature of his problem was revealed as bilaterally
> impacted cement-like ear cerumen.
>
> Neither a formal ear syringe, nor a syringe of any kind was available on
> the island. The day was very hot, and no one was particularly in the
> mood to boat to Honey Harbour and then drive 45 minutes to Midland, just
> on account of ear wax. One of the owners of the property was consulted
> in his capacity as a professional engineer and the owner of a superbly
> stocked tool shed (rivalling a mid-sized Canadian Tire). He was not able
> to offer any substitute contraption of his own but suggested we approach
> his 4-year-old grandson to see if we could use his pressured water
> cannon.

>
> D.K. (a family and emergency physician) assessed the utility of the
> Super Soaker Max-D 5000. He was surprised to note that it was able to
> deliver a superbly pressured narrow stream of water equivalent to, or
> perhaps exceeding, the quality of that achieved with standard
> ear-syringing instruments. The owner of the Super Soaker Max-D 5000 was
> sought out; after hearing an explanation of its intended application, he
> granted permission for its use.
>
> Verbal consent (covering risks and benefits) was obtained from the
> patient. He then changed into swimming shorts, located himself on an
> ideal location on the deck and held a Tupperware container (product
> number 1611-16) to the side of his neck, in lieu of a kidney basin. The
> Super Soaker Max-D 5000 was filled with body-temperature water and then
> mildly pressurized using the blue hand-pump. The trigger was depressed,
> releasing a gentle, narrow jet of water, which was then aimed along the
> posterior wall of the ear canal. After approximately 15
> seconds, the jet was aimed along the anterior wall. This cycle was
> repeated (with occasional repressurizing) until the Super Soaker was
> empty.
>
> Midway through the second load's stream, wax particles began to run out
> of the ear. Just after starting the third load, a large plug of wax
> burst forth from the patient's ear. The 3 generations of family members
> present took turns admiring (or recoiling from) the specimen. The
> patient exclaimed in joy, “I can hear again!”
>
> The entire process was repeated for the right ear. Otoscopy was
> repeated, revealing both tympanic membranes to be free of cerumen,
> intact and in excellent condition.
>
> The patient later reported a resumption in his nighttime ability to hear
> his infant son crying, which led to his being able to promptly jump out
> of bed and attend to his son's needs, excluding breast-feeding. This
> return to normal enhanced the state of their marital bliss on this
> island location.

> ## Comments
>
> The clinician operator of the device was impressed by the
> Super Soaker's ease of use for this procedure. Specifically, the ability
> to control a narrow, mildly pressurized jet of water was considered
> excellent. As well, the device only had to be refilled once or twice
> before the cerumen was removed from each ear. This is in contrast to his
> experience of requiring up to 10 or more refills of standard
> ear-syringing equipment. Using the Super Soaker in standard practice
> could then lead to decreased overall time spent on this procedure,
> resulting in shorter waiting times for patients through increased
> physician efficiency.
>
> A disadvantage to the Super Soaker was that the very useful blue
> hand-pump (used to pressurize the water) also prevented the device from
> getting close to the ear. This meant that the jet had to start
> approximately 5.0–7.5 cm from the patient, leading to significant
> backsplash toward the operator, and significant dousing of the patient
> (well in excess of that from the use of standard ear-syringing
> equipment). Any risk to the operator from this backsplash could be
> reduced in the future with the use of protective personal equipment,
> including a face-shield and gown.
>
> We feel that prospective randomized trials are warranted to evaluate the
> utility of the Super Soaker Max-D 5000 in clinical settings.

Just a couple of images I found interesting recently:

![Bouncing Water](/images/bouncingwater.gif "Bouncing Water")
Look how many times the water bounces in this ultra-high speed capture
of a falling water drop.

![Barrier Illusion](/images/cement-block-illusion.gif "Barrier Illusion") 
Perspective and point of view are everything in this illusion.

A rare treat for Grand Canyon visitors (enough to cause the locals to come out as well), a total cloud inversion occurred in the Grand Canyon.

> Grand Canyon Experiences Rare Weather Phenomenon
> ================================================

> Grand Canyon visitors were treated to a rare weather phenomenon Thursday
> when a dense layer of clouds filled up the 6,000-foot-deep canyon like a
> bathtub.
>
> The phenomenon, **[known as a total cloud inversion](http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/slc/climate/TemperatureInversions.php)**,
> occurs when warm air aloft traps clouds closer to the surface of the
> ground. This time around the inversion trapped colder clouds lower in
> the atmosphere, just below the rim of the canyon, creating billowy white
> views for miles in all directions in the expanse below.
>
> A video taken by[**Andrew Storey**](http://makiandandy.com/) (shown
> below) posted to youtube shows the cloud cover taking form.
>
> Grand Canyon National Park officials told *The Atlantic* that cloud
> inversions **[only occur at the park once in a decade](http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2013/12/a-sea-of-clouds-fills-the-grand-canyon/100640/)**,
> so they went out to snap the photos you see in the slideshow below.
>
> Despite its typical rarity, a similar sceneÂ **[actually took place at the Grand Canyon just last year.](/science/news/rare-sight-grand-canyon-20131202)**
>
> Only visitors to the national landmark Thursday were afforded the view.
> Cory Mottice of the National Weather Service told the Associated Press
> that the cloud cover will slowly dissipate over the coming days, meaning
> cloud cover peaked Thursday.
>
> Still, as the Daily Mail reports, **[tourists lucky enough to catch a glimpse of the scene didn't quite know what to do](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2870642/Clouds-Grand-Canyon-rare-weather-event.html)**
> with the cloud covered canyon. Many park visitors complained about their
> obscured view of the valley below, prompting park rangers to explain the
> rarity of the event.
>
> "Word spread like wildfire and most ran to the rim to photograph it,"
> Park Ranger Erin Whittaker told the Daily Mail. "What a fantastic treat
> for all!"

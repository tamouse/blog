via [Laughing Squid][laughingsquid] comes an article about "The Color Thesaurus" put together by [Ingrid Sundberg](http://ingridsnotes.wordpress.com/author/ingridsundberg/). As a [watercolourist][deviantart], I truly appreciate the collection Ingrid has compiled here.

> The Color Thesaurus
> ===================

> I love to collect words. Making word lists can help to find the [voice
> of my story](http://ingridsnotes.wordpress.com/2010/09/20/your-voice-is-your-voice-keeping-it-real/),
> dig into [the emotion of a scene](http://ingridsnotes.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/lets-get-visual/),
> or [create variety](http://ingridsnotes.wordpress.com/2013/09/03/the-right-word/).

> One of my on-going word collections is of colors. I love to stop in the
> paint section of a hardware store and find new names for red or white or
> yellow.  Having a variety of color names at my fingertips helps me to
> create specificity in my writing. I can paint a more evocative image in
> my reader’s mind if I describe a character’s hair as the color of rust
> or carrot-squash, rather than red.

> So for fun, I created this color thesaurus for your reference. Of
> course, there are plenty more color names  in the world, so, this is
> just to get you started.

> Fill your stories with a rainbow of images!

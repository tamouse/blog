> project,
> *[La Frontera: Artists from the U.S. Mexican Border](http://borderartists.com/)*,
> examines the borderland's flourishing arts communities with
> photographs of more than 170 painters, muralists, art promoters,
> museum directors and musicians. 

> “It's a story as true as those about crimes and violence,” Falke
> says. “There are a lot of amazing cultural activities going on along
> the border, on both sides. Artists are the pulse of societies and
> they can have a tremendous positive influence on their communities.” 

> Falke, who lives in New York, was born in Germany. His interest in
> national borders stems from his experience growing up in the shadow
> of the Iron Curtain. 

> “We lived with a physical border dividing my country,” he says. “I
> was drawn to the U.S.-Mexico border after the Berlin Wall came down
> in 1989. Since then, the U.S.-Mexico border wall has been
> continuously growing. I wondered about all the bad news coming from
> *La Frontera* and had to check it out for myself.”

> Falke's first portraits of artists were made on a trip to Tijuana
> in 2008. He has since traveled to different parts of the border
> eight times. In 2012, he
> [crowdfunded nearly \$9,000 for the project](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/la-frontera-artists-along-the-us-mexican-border).

> The majority of his work has been made on the Mexican side in cities
> such as Tecate, Nogales, Ciudad Juarez, Mexicali and Nuevo
> Laredo. But he has also
> [photographed in U.S. cities](http://borderartists.com/category/x-north-of-the-border-usa/)
> — most recently in Brownsville, Texas. During his time on the border
> — which Falke describes as “almost its own country, a region
> unparalleled anywhere, good and bad” — he has only felt unsafe once.

> “There were hand grenades or other small explosives going off near
> my hotel in Matamoros one night. I literally fell out of my
> bed. This was the only time I thought I might be in trouble,” Falke
> says.

> The rest of the time he's been welcomed by everyone he's approached.

> “People are positively surprised that anybody would do what I do
> because most international photographers who come here want to shoot
> crime scenes or work on stories about the drug wars or immigration
> related issues,” Falke says. “The support from the artists in every
> city I have been to is just fantastic. Everybody I photograph
> recommends other artists to meet.”

> One of Falke's main goals with *La Frontera Project* is to create a
> bilingual and interactive website that presents the artists'
> portraits and edited photo stories alongside their corresponding
> web-links, career information and activities. The site would serve
> as a hub.

> “It could connect artists and art institutions along the entire
> border, on both sides, which each other,” he says.

> Because the region is so vast he's got no shortage of material and
> is excited to keep exploring both the major cities and smaller towns
> that dot the nearly 2,000-mile border between the two countries.

> “I am having a ball working on this project. It took on its own
> life, and it is hard to quit,” he says.

> **Explanation:** Sometimes it's hard to decide which is more impressive -- the land or the sky. On the land of the [featured image](https://www.facebook.com/DiegoRizzoPhoto/posts/2122092341173956), for example, the Volcano of Fire ([Volc√°n de Fuego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volc%C3%A1n_de_Fuego)) is seen erupting topped by red-hot, [wind-blown ash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AQR8VQl-s) and with streams of glowing lava running down its side. Lights from neighboring towns are seen through a thin haze below. In the sky, though, the central plane of our [Milky Way Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) runs diagonally from the upper left, with a fleeting [meteor](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181215.html) just below, and the [trail of a satellite](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080604.html) to the upper right. The planet [Jupiter](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/) also appears toward the upper left, with the bright star [Antares](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180702.html) just to its right. Much of the land and the sky were [captured together in a single, well-timed, 25-second exposure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGh3cCmy5zg) taken in mid-April from the side of [Fuego](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150311.html)'s sister volcano [Acatenango](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acatenango) in Guatemala. The image of the meteor, though, was captured in a similar frame taken about 30 minutes earlier -- when the volanic eruption was not as photogenic -- and added later digitally.

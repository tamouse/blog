> In October 1965, CDR Clarence W. Stoddard, Jr., Executive Officer of
> VA-25 "Fist of the Fleet", flying A-1H Skyraider Bu. No. 135297,
> NE/572, from Carrier Air Wing Two aboard USS Midway, carried a
> special bomb to the North Vietnamese in commemoration of the
> 6-millionth pound of ordnance dropped. This bomb was unique because
> of the type..... it was a toilet! Also unique to this mission is the
> fact this aircraft was named "Paper Tiger II" (a temporary name used
> for just this one flight).

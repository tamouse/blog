Cloud Paintings Made from Collected Raindrops

!["Rio de Janeiro" - The Rain Paintings, Gustavo Sousa](/images/therainpaintings-riodejanerio.jpg) 

> In the watercolor series
[“therainpaintings,”](http://therainpaintings.tumblr.com/) Brazilian
artist [Gustavo Sousa](https://twitter.com/gustavoluzsousa) collects
raindrops and uses them to make watercolors of the very clouds that
created the rain in the first place. Each painting includes a note of
when and where the rain was collected. Sousa has been making the
paintings during his travels to Europe, the United States, and Brazil.

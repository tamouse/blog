It takes too long to get the point of writing something, that I've forgotten what I want to write.

I seem to have built myself a ridiculously long process to write a blog post, where my blog repo is not on the machine.

I'm writing this entry in Notion [and subsequently copy/pasted into emacs], which isn't really how I want to make blog posts, but at least I can get something out of my head while I wait for bundler to finish.

I need to fix this.

[Cory Doctorow](https://twitter.com/doctorow "writer, speaker, thinker, freedom figher") has talked about a process he uses to source his work and then push it out to the various places he posts, i.e. twitter, others, and his blog(s).

It could also be said I have too many computers I do personal stuff on. I need to sort that out, too.

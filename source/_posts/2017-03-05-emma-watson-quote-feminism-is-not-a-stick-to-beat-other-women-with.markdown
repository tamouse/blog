> "It just always reveals to me how many misconceptions and what a misunderstanding there is about what feminism is," she said during an interview with Reuters. "Feminism is about giving women choice, feminism is not a stick with which to beat other women with, it's about freedom, it's about liberation, it's about equality. I really don't know what my tits have to do with it. It's very confusing."

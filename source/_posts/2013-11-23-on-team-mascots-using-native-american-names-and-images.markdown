> # A white man and an elderly Native man became pretty good friends, so the white guy decided to ask him: “What do you think about Indian  mascots?” 
> &mdash; Kent Nerburn

Continuing:

> The Native elder responded, “Here’s what you’ve got to
  understand. When you look at black people, you see ghosts of all the
  slavery and the rapes and the hangings and the chains. When you look
  at Jews, you see ghosts of all those bodies piled up in death
  camps. And those ghosts keep you trying to do the right thing. “But
  when you look at us you don’t see the ghosts of the little babies
  with their heads smashed in by rifle butts at the Big Hole, or the
  old folks dying by the side of the trail on the way to Oklahoma
  while their families cried and tried to make them comfortable, or
  the dead mothers at Wounded Knee or the little kids at Sand Creek
  who were shot for target practice. You don’t see any ghosts at
  all. “Instead you see casinos and drunks and junk cars and
  shacks. “Well, we see those ghosts. And they make our hearts sad and
  they hurt our little children. And when we try to say something, you
  tell us, ‘Get over it. This is America. Look at the American dream.’
  But as long as you’re calling us Redskins and doing tomahawk chops,
  we can’t look at the American dream, because those things remind us
  that we are not real human beings to you. And when people aren’t
  humans, you can turn them into slaves or kill six million of them or
  shoot them down with Hotchkiss guns and throw them into mass graves
  at Wounded Knee. “No, we’re not looking at the American dream. And
  why should we? 


> # We still haven’t woken up from the American nightmare.”

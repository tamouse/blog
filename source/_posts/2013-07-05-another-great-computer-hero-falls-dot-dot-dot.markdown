On Friday, Jul 3rd 2013, another great hero of computer technology,
Douglas Englebart, passed away at the age of 88.

There really is no measuring the impact Englebart has had on computer
systems, especially personal computer systems. The mouse, the
graphical interface, interactive computing, and so on, and so on.

Probably the most *seminal* presentation is the one made in 1968 that
introduced the nice goodies he and his team had been working on at
Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park, California.

The "Mother of all Demos" is captured, and up on
[Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY). (Hopefully, the
following embed will work as well!)

The man was amazing. Englebart is actually the person everyone things
Steve Jobs was.

Langston Hughes, black American poet, wrote the poem "I, Too"



> I, too, sing America.
>
> I am the darker brother. <br />
> They send me to eat in the kitchen <br />
> When company comes, <br />
> But I laugh, <br />
> And eat well, <br />
> And grow strong. <br />
>
> Tomorrow, <br />
> I’ll be at the table <br />
> When company comes. <br />
> Nobody’ll dare <br />
> Say to me, <br />
> “Eat in the kitchen,” <br />
> Then. <br />
>
> Besides, <br />
> They’ll see how beautiful I am <br />
> And be ashamed &mdash; <br />
>
> I, too, am America.

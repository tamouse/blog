Some great quotes by the people who created Silicon Valley and at the time one of the best companies ever.

​1. The greatest success goes to the person who is not
afraid to fail in front of even the largest audience.

​2. Set out to build a company and make a contribution, not an empire
and a fortune.

​3. The best possible company management is one that combines a sense of
corporate greatness and destiny, with empathy for, and fidelity to, the
average employee.

​4. The biggest competitive advantage is to do the right thing at the
worst time.

​5. A company that focuses solely on profits ultimately betrays both
itself and society.

​6. Corporate reorganizations should be made for cultural reasons more
than financial ones.

​7. A frustrated employee is a greater threat than a merely unhappy one.

​8. The job of a manager is to support his or her staff, not vice versa
and that begins by being among them.

​9. The best business decisions are the most humane decisions.  And, all
other talents being even, the greatest managers are also the most human
managers.

​10. Investing in new product development
and expanding the product catalog are the most difficult things to do in
hard times, and also among the most important.

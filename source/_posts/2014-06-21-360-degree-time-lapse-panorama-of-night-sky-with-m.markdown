I love pictures of the night sky, especially where you can see unobstructed by light pollution. I also love time-lapse photography. I absolutely go spare when they are combined. I love panoramic pictures, too. Now, Vincent Brady has combined all of them together to make me just weep with joy at their beauty. Although the lens and cameras distort the 3D 360 degree panoramic view onto a 2D scene, this invokes more truth about what we're seeing than any static landscape shot ever could. Sure, the camera lies, but when you can take that lie and use it to expose deeper beauty, I am *all* for it!

The awesome folks at [Symphony of
Science](http://www.symphonyofscience.com/) have put out their newest
installment: [Monsters of the Cosmos](http://youtu.be/7e5-0t0pTF0 )
that is all about black holes.

Set it to full screen and turn up the speakers, sit back and enjoy!

[Symphony of Science][sos] is an awesome project that takes scientists'
and others' words and autotunes them into a rather marvelous and
delicious blending of sound, music and images that bring the science
speakers' words to life in a new and exciting way.

* (okay this was the 7th):
[The Leggero](http://www.waltsiegl.com/portfolio/leggero-manhattan-2013/)
This is one of most beautiful motorcycles I've seen since my friend bought
a Buell.

* Cooking in Space with Samantha!
  [Cooking in space: mackerel, quinoa and leek cream tortilla ](https://youtu.be/gRllv78Gax8)
  Sure hope someone grabbed those bits that went flying off. :)

* One of my fav webcomics is ending,
  sorta. [Listen WHile You Can](http://www.asofterworld.com/index.php?id=1243)
  is their last one... maybe.

* Could you live in this?
[Tiny Solar and Wind Powered Home](http://www.visualnews.com/2015/06/06/futuristic-mobile-tiny-home-powered-solar-wind/).


* [Avdi Grimm](http://avdi.org)'s [devblog](http://devblog.avdi.org/).
I love reading everything he writes. I so want to be like him someday.
Maybe when I have more time...

* ["Features"](http://thedoghousediaries.com/6012) on [Dog House Diaries](http://thedoghousediaries.com/).
How all those product brainstorming meetings go...

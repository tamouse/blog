> The Contact Series
> ==================
> 
> **The Contact Series of LEGO built creations was designed to promote the
> beauty of all intelligent life forms as extensions of our family –
> children under the same creative force.**
> 
> This is a story where human consciousness rediscovers the art of
> intuition and the subtle – but powerful – forces of the universe. Here,
> groups of modern humans use ancient rituals which – in combination with
> expanded consciousness – initiates communication with the great space
> faring cultures of the universe. Vectoring extraterrestrial beings to
> their position on earth, these humans invite the visitors to help heal
> the planet through the ETs' transformative powers and bring the greater
> Earth community closer to the spiritual nature of the universe.
> 
> In the Contact Series, war, self interest and materialistic thinking are
> products of the less evolved species – such as humans. While there are
> others like us in the universe, the vast collection of sentient beings
> spread throughout the universe have either evolved beyond this or never
> had concepts as these in their culture.
> 
> Understanding the spiritual nature and properties of the universe helps
> societies to unlock powerful forces which greatly improve the quality of
> life. The forces include out of body travel (astral travel), healing,
> telepathy with all life forms (including plants and animals), weather
> control, trans location, space travel, instant plant growth,
> materialization of objects through sound and thought and much more.
> Generally speaking, what we perceive as supernatural, paranormal or
> miraculous are simply expressions of this power. The most spiritually
> advanced of the cultures have evolved close to celestial.
> 
> All advanced technologies dovetail into this spiritual story. For
> example, traveling beyond home systems is only possible through a
> combination of advanced electronics and consciousness expansion. Ships
> are manufactured conscious entities which interface with star travelers.
> Forged in the astral realm through pure tones, these living trans
> dimensional transport vehicles fold out of linear space time allowing
> for movement at the speed of consciousness – which is limitless.
> 
> Now for the catch. In order to access and interface in this manner, one
> must resonate at a high frequency (or of kindness). Malevolent levels of
> consciousness simply cannot access this kind of advancement. For this
> reason, interstellar war is not an option. Ships have no weapons.The
> vast multitude of sentient, space faring races keep track of lower
> evolved, spiritually empty races that enter atomic and space ages.
> Quarantines are put up around such planets to maintain peace in local
> areas of space. Missions to neutralize atomic weapons are part of the
> quarantine process. And so it is with earth…
> 
> Future 'Contact' works will feature celebrations of expanded
> consciousness, loving and caring moments of ETs, contact events and
> other celebration from our brothers and sisters throughout the universe.

> # First Work: The Millennial Celebration of the  Eternal Choir at K'al Yne, Odan
> 
> The series begins with Odan – one of the New Worlds. Like Earth, their
> civilization is young – under two hundred thousand years old. Unlike
> Earth, their species evolved from mammals that did not have inter
> species killing. The concept of war and murder remained unknown to this
> race as a result of these early evolutionary behaviors. This allowed for
> the quick advancement along cultural and spiritual tracks.
> 
> One of Odan's great cultural icons is the Eternal Choir. Based in the
> small, but ancient town of K'al Yne, the choir has been singing
> uninterrupted for 1,000 years. Thousands of citizens participate a few
> hours a day forming an atmosphere filled with music. Now, the millennial
> celebration has come and visitors throughout this and many other
> galaxies have come to witness the event. Like many of the Great Choirs,
> music is sung both in the physical and astral. This has the effect of
> purifying elements, such as soil, water and air, preventing illnesses
> and promoting the growth of enhanced spiritual fruits – making for an
> especially high standard of living.

> 
> K'al Yne is a popular local galactic vacation spot. Visitors can expect
> powerful spiritual food grown locally, wonderful astral vacation
> chambers, beautiful meditation temples all in a charming small town
> setting. While there are not as many physical activities here in K'al
> Yne, the ancient town more than makes up for it with particularly
> advanced astral vacation chambers. Here, visitors can enjoy long
> assisted meditation sessions – which can last a few days to weeks –
> while adventuring in a variety of exciting astral realms. These realms –
> free of physical restraints – offer a heightened degree of intensity
> (whether relaxing or adventuring) than can be found in the physical.
> 
> The architecture in K'al Yne was modeled after many of the spiritual
> centers from the old cultures in its galactic cluster. Buildings are
> mostly windowless which keep night light pollution to a minimum – a must
> for night meditation in the stars. "Windows" are projected through fiber
> optic like devices which open entire walls up completely to the outside.
> This technology brings in light, perfect views, cool breezes and the
> sounds of the city.

> *Dedicated to my parents, Mike and Mina, my wife Stephanie, my sons Ian
> and Caeden, Rev. Howard Storm and Dr Steven Greer.*
> 
> [Rev. Howard Storm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd_FUrC5aoA) briefly
> died in 1985 due a ruptured duodenum. It has been said that his account
> of the afterlife and of after death evil spirits is the most complete
> modern day description given. At the time an atheist, the experience had
> such a powerful effect as to bring him into religious studies after the
> event. His testimony offers a glimpse into the existence of other
> intelligent beings and our relationship to them.
> 
> Dr. Steven Greer, a former emergency room surgeon and transcendental
> meditation instructor founded the [Disclosure
> Project](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vyVe-6YdUk) and global
> Disclosure movement. The Disclosure Project confirms the reality of ET
> visitations through testimonies collected from hundreds of credible
> individuals – from astronauts and cosmonauts, pilots (commercial and
> military), an FAA director, high ranking members of the CIA, contractors
> with high security clearances to the military industrial complex, NASA,
> JPL and on and on. These personal, firsthand accounts shed light on the
> secrecy and intimidation brought on through the military industrial
> complex.
> 
> Dr Greer also has developed CE-5 (close encounters of the 5th kind)
> protocols which he leads regular expeditions to successful contact.
> Here, groups of people travel to remote locations to learn expanded
> consciousness meditation techniques which consistently draw ET in a
> variety of forms – from fully materialized craft to partially
> materialized crafts and beings.
> 
> In addition, Dr Greer is founder of the Orion Project, an organization
> aiming to create a world of sustainability and enlightened abundance
> through the funding of new energy systems.  The goal of the Orion
> project is to provide a highly transparent multi disciplined research
> center where scientists can work without fear of intimidation from the
> current energy industry and government sectors (military industrial
> complex) under the petrol dollar control.

> Special thanks to Matt Doyle for his photographic expertise and
> assistance in capturing this first Contact work.

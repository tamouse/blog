This link goes to an article in the [Public Domain Review](https://publicdomainreview.org/) and is from a few years back. (I can't tell exactly because the article seems to be undated)

The [collection](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=%22lot%2011931%22%20NOT%20medal&st=grid&co=anedub&loclr=blogpic "Link to the Library of Congress archive") is housed at the Library of Congress' online archive.

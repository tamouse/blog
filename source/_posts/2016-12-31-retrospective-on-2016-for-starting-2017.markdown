So, it's New Year's Eve 2016. A traditional time for reflection. The
following are not resolutions, however. Taking my queue from Agile
retrospectives, I've written the "Do More Of, Do Less Of, and Keep the
Same":




## Things I want to do more of in 2017:

- write / journal more
- draw / sketch more
- paint outside of painting class
- document my learnings more often
- organize these things and make them habitual
- walk

## Things I want to do less of in 2017:

- eating carbohydrates
- hoarding cardboard boxes
- social media

## Things I'm planning to keep about the same in 2017:

- reading
- learning
- practicing

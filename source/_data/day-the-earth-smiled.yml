      On July 19, 2013, in an event celebrated the world over, NASA's
      Cassini spacecraft slipped into Saturn's shadow and turned to
      image the planet, seven of its moons, its inner rings -- and, in
      the background, our home planet, Earth.

      With the sun's powerful and potentially damaging rays eclipsed
      by Saturn itself, Cassini's onboard cameras were able to take
      advantage of this unique viewing geometry. They acquired a
      panoramic mosaic of the Saturn system that allows scientists to
      see details in the rings and throughout the system as they are
      backlit by the sun. This mosaic is special as it marks the third
      time our home planet was imaged from the outer solar system; the
      second time it was imaged by Cassini from Saturn's orbit; and
      the first time ever that inhabitants of Earth were made aware in
      advance that their photo would be taken from such a great
      distance.

      With both Cassini's wide-angle and narrow-angle cameras aimed at
      Saturn, Cassini was able to capture 323 images in just over four
      hours. This final mosaic uses 141 of those wide-angle
      images. Images taken using the red, green and blue spectral
      filters of the wide-angle camera were combined and mosaicked
      together to create this natural-color view. A brightened version
      with contrast and color enhanced (Figure 1), a version with just
      the planets annotated (Figure 2), and an annotated version
      (Figure 3) are shown above.

      This image spans about 404,880 miles (651,591 kilometers) across.

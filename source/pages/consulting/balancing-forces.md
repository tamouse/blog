The Five Powers are derived in Bhuddist teaching. They apply equally
to developing a consulting practice for one's self, and being able to
help people solve their problems.

## Balancing Forces

Sometimes referred to as the Five Powers, the table below shows how
different focuses balance for building or diminishing your
mental power.


| build mental power | diminish mental power |
|-------------------:|:----------------------|
|   confidence/trust | doubt                 |
|             energy | lethargy              |
|      concentration | distraction           |
|        mindfulness | forgetfulness         |
|            insight | confusion             |

## Confidence / Trust

This might in some cases be called "faith" but is not the sort of
confidence one puts into scripture or belief without fact, the sort of
confidence or trust here is more on the order of a presupposition: in
which we *act* as if the thing we are presupposing is true. Here, we
are talking about confidence and trust in yourself, in knowing you can
overcome the problems that you have, that you have the answers for
them within yourself, and that you can do so through practice, living
with your uncertainties about the situation, but keep going, and being
open to the insights when they come.

In consulting, we often have to get the client to believe they have
the ability to find their own solutions, and we also have to keep
confident in our ability to help them do so.

## Energy

Your internal strength, energy, your ability to continue in the face
of daunting obstacles. Focusing on your energy, even while you feel
you may have little, causes it to expand and gives you more access to
it.

It also means addressing behaviours that may be limiting or draining
your energy, such as a particular job, relationship, personal habits,
and so on. It doesn't mean ignoring them, or walking away from them,
but taking inventory, and focusing on positive aspects, and ways you
might be able to practice and change the situations, including your
approach to them and your thoughts about them.

This is often about addressing for the client the things which are
keeping them stuck or preventing them from achieving progress towards
their desired state.

## Concentration

Concentration is a practice of focus, and of bringing together. The
concept of synthesizing new thoughts and ideas out of existing, and
being able to reframe in order to achieve some insight or
enlightenment. It's opposite, distraction, is ever-present in our
practice as well; distractions provide the opportunity to concentrate
again, and refocus.

Whenever you show up for a client, your concentration should be on
their issues, their agenda, and focusing on what they can achieve as
progress towards their desired state in this visit.

## Mindfulness

This is the practice of being aware without judgment of the present
moment. Being able to see things as they are, without our lenses of
judgment, expectation, and bias is important for gaining insight into
our current situations.

Mindfulness, like these others is a *practice*, not a destination, or
a goal; it is a state of mind from which other things become
possible. It's opposing force, forgetfulness, is like distraction
above, in that it will always be present and possible, and provides
another opportunity to return to mindfulness.

Practising mindfulness for clients is staying in the present moment
during interactions, and assisting them to acquire a state of
mindfulness and resourcefulness.


## Insight

This is the mid-goal of practice, to achieve some form of wisdom about
a situation, but not the usual form we associate with wisdom. Insight
is practical, it is experiential, it is visceral and direct. It is not
seeking explanations, judgments, but is seeing truly what is.

This mid-goal should still have with it the end goal, the desired
state, for the client; what insight should provide is the ability to
move forward towards that goal.

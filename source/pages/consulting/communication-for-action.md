# Communication for Action

## Making requests for what you want

In order to get the things you want, often you have to request things of someone. This can also be used for self-directed actions, i.e., you are making requests of yourself.

* **Presupposition:** both parties are willing to negotiate to a consensus.

* **Presupposition:** the intention of both parties is to produce (realize) the outcome.

* **Presupposition:** all behavior is the result of an initial good intention from the point of view of actor.

An **outcome** is often divided into two parts: a **request** and a **commitment** are two halves of a whole **Conversation For Action** (a concept put forth by Terry Winograd of Stanford University). The purpose of the conversation is to have a person make a request of another person, the second person commit (or promise) to fulfill the request.

* a **request** is in the form of a question
* a **commitment** is in the form of an assertion

### Canonical Request Form:

> "I request that you perform *X* delivering *Y* by time *T*"

### Canonical Response Forms:

One of:

* Acceptance:

> "I will do *X* delivering *Y* at time *T*."

* Decline:

>  "I decline."

* Counteroffer: A counteroffer to negotiate the specifications of *X*, *Y*, and *T*. 

> "I can't do *X* but I can do *X(1)*, by date *T(1)*. Is that ok?"

* A commitment to a future commitment

> "I can't tell you now, but I'll get back to you about it on *date*."

## Protocols

All requests require a response; there is no such thing as silence equals agreement. The opposite is the case: if no response is made, the requestor should consider the request declined.

## Well-formedness and Inquiry

The [well-formedness of the outcome / request / commitment][well-formed-outcomes] is the result of the full and independent commitment of both parties agreeing to and having, or being able to aquire, the resources, skills and knowledge to achieve the outcome / request / commitment. Each party is completely and independently responsible for the well-formedness of the outcome / request / commitment.

The recipient of the request may need to spend time in [Precision Inquiry][precision-inquiry] in order to assure the well-formedness, desireability, and specifications of the [desired outcome][desired-outcome].

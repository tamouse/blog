<p>It’s all about the food, innit?</p>

<h2 id="wednesday-evening-prep">Wednesday Evening Prep</h2>

<p>So turkey day, two thousand and fourteen is here. I started preparing stuff for our threesome’s family meal yesterday, 
by making a pumpkin pie, cornbread for the dressing, and cranberry sauce.</p>

<p>The event wouldn’t be complete without at least one <em>crise du cuisine</em> and this years was trying to get some old pie dough
I had in the fridge to unroll cleanly. It didn’t. It stuck to itself. It wouldn’t come cleanly off. <em>le sigh</em>.</p>

<p>Luckily, Mom was there to save the day. I did manage to get it mostly unrolled and onto the pie plate, but with these <em>huge</em> holes in it. With careful pressing, cutting excess fringe, and tapping into place, Mom made the pie crust work. In went 
the pie filling, with a bit left over, and it baked up nice as you like.</p>

<p>The pumpkin pie, chortling merrily to itself:</p>

<p><a href="http://tt.imageshare.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/2014-11-27-thanksgiving-dinner-2014/20141126_204823.jpg"><img src="http://tt.imageshare.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/2014-11-27-thanksgiving-dinner-2014/small/20141126_204823.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Making the cornbread was dead easy, as it’s just a box of the Jiffy mix, a negg and du l’eau, and in a greased pan for 20. “BAM!”.</p>

<p>The cranberry sauce was a bit of a problem, as it had too much liquid, so was really more like soup than sauce.</p>

<p>With that all done, my back aching, my feet crying, I shuffled off to bed leaving a hugely messy kitchen.</p>

<h2 id="thursday-morning">Thursday Morning</h2>

<p>After a great breakfast of oatmeal with dates, Mimsy and I reconnoitered around the rest of the meal. Neither of us could quite remember the equation for how many minutes per pound to cook an unstuffed bird, but after investigating a few places, settled on 15 minutes per pound. (This is now recorded in my recipe file.)</p>

<p>Here’s the notes for the meal:</p>

<p><a href="http://tt.imageshare.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/2014-11-27-thanksgiving-dinner-2014/20141127_173454.jpg"><img src="http://tt.imageshare.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/2014-11-27-thanksgiving-dinner-2014/small/20141127_173454.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<h2 id="turkey">Turkey</h2>

<p>Washed, drained, patted dry and set aboard a roasting pan. Breast skin slit open with butter liberally applied within. Salt and pepper in the cavity and over the top, with montreal chicken season sprinkled on top as well.</p>

<p>In the oven at 400 at 10:30, turned down to 325 and tented half an hour later. The turkey got only a 3 bastings, but I think it came out quite juicy and tender 3 hours later.</p>

<h2 id="dressing">Dressing</h2>

<p>This was the bog-standard family dressing, cornbread and stale bread crumbs, onions, celery, chix broth and, of course, <strong>raisins</strong>! Can not do dressing without raisins. :) This time, I used 1/4 cup regular brown raisins and 1/4 cup golden raisins. I didn’t have enough sage, but it still worked out well. Yummy stuff.</p>

<h2 id="yams">Yams</h2>

<p>I had two fairly good-sized yams, but they were these odd shaped things, so I ended up making them into oven fry wedges and roasting them with the dressing. The usual treatment: spray with cooking oil lightly, sprinkle on a bit of seasoned salt, pepper, and Old Bay seasoning.</p>

<h2 id="rhutabagas">Rhutabagas</h2>

<p>A Swedish tradition, at least in our Swedish household, boiled up some cubed rhutabags. Simple, easy, nothing to it.</p>

<h2 id="cranberry-sauce-part-ii">Cranberry Sauce, Part II</h2>

<p>The sauce I made last night was still all runny, so I did the horrible thing of pitching it and remaking it with the right amount of liquid. Much better.</p>

<h2 id="gravy">Gravy</h2>

<p>The turkey came with a gravy packet inside, which I used with the pan drippings and a bit more water. This came up marvelously, not too salty.</p>

<p>The problem was serving it. The usual serving pitcher was in the dishwasher, running mid-cycle. Oops. A pewter gravy boat was suggested, but whoa what a mistake. That boat takes on <em>all</em> the heat of whatever is in it, so it was impossible to pour out of or pass. Sacrificing pretties for safety, I used a measuring pitcher instead. Worked a treat.</p>

<h2 id="pickles">Pickles</h2>

<p>Small dishes of hot bread and butter pickles, watermelon pickles, and (ick) green olive and pimento rounded things out commestible-wsie.</p>

<h2 id="lingonberry-and-apple-cider">Lingonberry and Apple Cider</h2>

<p>Kristian Regale Lingonberry and Apple cider filled our glasses of cheer.</p>

<h2 id="served-at-a-wonderful-200-pm">Served at a wonderful 2:00 pm.</h2>

<p>A very civilized hour for Thanksgiving dinner.</p>

<p>I wish I had taken a picture of the table. I think I did a fair job on setting and presentation.</p>

<p>Here, at least, is my plated serving:</p>

<p>Everything was super delicious.</p>

<p>Much cheer and fun was had by us.</p>

<p>Happy Thanksgiving whereever you are!</p>

      <p>“I now do more than oppose the extension of slavery. I am not a
Know-Nothing. That is certain. How could I be? How can any one who
abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor of degrading classes”</p>

<p>“pretty rapid. As a nation, we began by declaring that “all men are
created equal.” We now practically read it “all men are created
equal, except negroes.” When the Know-Nothings get control, it
will read “all men are created equal, except negroes, and
foreigners, and catholics.” When it comes to this I should prefer
emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving
liberty — to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be take
pure, and without the base alloy of hypocracy [sic].”</p>

<p><strong>What is the most astounding fact you can share with us about the Universe?</strong></p>

<p>The most astounding fact is the knowledge that the atoms that
comprise life on Earth, the atoms that make up the human body, are
traceable to the crucibles that cooked light elements into heavy
elements in their core under extreme temperatures and
pressures. These stars, the high mass ones among them went
unstable in their later years. They collapsed and then exploded
scattering their enriched guts across the galaxy; guts made of
carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and all the fundamental ingredients of
life itself. These ingredients become part of gas clouds that
condense, collapse, form the next generation of solar systems
stars with orbiting planets, and those planets now have the
ingredients for life itself.</p>

<p>So that when I look up at the night sky and I know that yes, we
are part of this universe, we are in this universe, but perhaps
more important than both of those facts is that the Universe is in
us. When I reflect on that fact, I look up – many people feel
small because they’re small and the Universe is big – but I feel
big, because my atoms came from those stars. There’s a level of
connectivity. That’s really what you want in life, you want to
feel connected, you want to feel relevant; you want to feel like a
participant in the goings on of activities and events around you.</p>

<p>And that’s precisely what we are, just by being alive.</p>

      <p>I am not worried if scientists go and explain everything. This is
for a very simple reason: an impala sprinting across the Savannah
can be reduced to biomechanics, and Bach can be reduced to
counterpoint, yet that does not decrease one iota our ability to
shiver as we experience impalas leaping or Bach thundering. We can
only gain and grow with each discovery that there is structure
underlying the most accessible levels of things that fill us with
awe.</p>

<p>But there is an even stronger reason why I am not afraid that
scientists will inadvertently go and explain everything–it will
never happen. While in certain realms, it may prove to be the case
that science can explain anything, it will never explain
everything. As should be obvious after all these pages, as part of
the scientific process, for every question answered, a dozen newer
ones are generated. And they are usually far more puzzling, more
challenging than than the prior problems. This was stated
wonderfully in a quote by a geneticist named Haldane earlier in the
century: “Life is not only stranger than we imagine, it is stranger
than we can imagine.” We will never have our flames extinguished by
knowledge. The purpose of science is not to cure us of our sense of
mystery and wonder, but to constantly reinvent and reinvigorate it.</p>

      <p>I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s
great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the
White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white
moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who
prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a
positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly
says: “I agree with the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with
your methods of direct action”; <strong>who paternalistically
believes he can set the timetable for another man’s
freedom</strong>; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who
constantly advises the Negro to wait for a “more convenient
season”. <strong>Shallow understanding from people of good will is
more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill
will</strong>. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than
outright rejection.</p>

      <p>From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any
particular interest. But for us, it’s different. Consider again
that dot. That’s here. That’s home. That’s us. On it everyone you
love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human
being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our
joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies,
and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and
coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king
and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father,
hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals,
every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme
leader,” every saint and sinner in the history of our species
lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</p>

<p>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of
the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so
that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters
of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by
the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely
distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner. How frequent
their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another,
how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined
self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged
position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale
light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic
dark. In our obscurity – in all this vastness – there is no hint
that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.</p>

<p>The Earth is the only world known, so far, to harbor life. There
is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species
could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for
the moment, the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said
that astronomy is a humbling and character-building
experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly
of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To
me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one
another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only
home we’ve ever known.</p>

      <p>Many adults are put off when youngsters pose scientific
questions. Children ask why the sun is yellow, or what a dream is,
or how deep you can dig a hole, or when is the world’s birthday,
or why we have toes.</p>

<p>Too many teachers and parents answer with irritation or ridicule, or
quickly move on to something else. Why adults should pretend to
omniscience before a five-year-old, I can’t for the life of me
understand. What’s wrong with admitting that you don’t know?
Children soon recognize that somehow this kind of question annoys
many adults. A few more experiences like this, and another child has
been lost to science.</p>

<p>There are many better responses. If we have an idea of the answer,
we could try to explain. If we don’t, we could go to the
encyclopedia or the library. Or we might say to the child: “I don’t
know the answer. Maybe no one knows. Maybe when you grow up, you’ll
be the first to find out.”</p>

      <p>What an astonishing thing a book is.</p>

<p>It is a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which
are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it
and you are inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead
for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is
speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to
you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding
together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant
epochs. Books break the shackle of time. A book is proof that
humans are capable of working magic.</p>

<p>Poets say science takes away from the beauty of the stars— mere
globs of gas atoms. Nothing is ‘mere’. I too can see the stars on
a desert night, and feel them. But do I see less or more? The
vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination— stuck on this
carousel my little eye can catch one-million-year-old light. A
vast pattern— of which I am a part… What is the pattern or the
meaning or the why? It does not do harm to the mystery to know a
little more about it. For far more marvelous is the truth than any
artists of the past imagined it. Why do the poets of the present
not speak of it? What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he
were a man, but if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and
ammonia must be silent.</p>

      <p>There is a famous story told in Chassidic literature that
addresses this very question.</p>

<p>The Master teaches the student that God created everything in the
world to be appreciated, since everything is here to teach us a
lesson.</p>

<p>One clever student asks “What lesson can we learn from atheists?
Why did God create them?”</p>

<p>The Master responds, “God created atheists to teach us the most
important lesson of them all – the lesson of true compassion. You
see, when an ahteist performs an act of charity, visits someone
who is sick, helps someone in need, and cares for the world, he is
not doing so because of some religious teaching. He does not
believe that God commanded him to perform this act. In fact, he
does not believe in God at all, so his acts are based on an inner
sense of morality. And look at the kindness he can bestow upon
others simply because he feels it to be right.”</p>

<p>“This means,” the Master continued, “That when someone reaches out
to you for help, you should never say ‘I pray that God will help
you.’ Instead for the moment, you should become an atheist,
imagine that there is no God who can help and say ‘I will help you.’”</p>

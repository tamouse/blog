<p>title: “Lessons from the Geese”</p>

<p>I received this list unattributed over the net. If anyone knows the real authors, I’d be happy to make a reference.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-from-the-geese">Lessons from the Geese</h2>

<p>Geese migrate every Fall and Spring. Their migration is an awesome
sight. Geese have developed a strong interdependence that enables them
to make the long journey. Here are some lessons from the geese.</p>

<p><strong>Fact</strong> As each bird flaps its wings, it creates an “up lift” for the
bird following. By flying in “V”-formation, the whole flock adds 71%
greater flying range than if each bird flew alone.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson</strong> People who share a common direction and sense of community
can get where they are going quicker and easier because they are
traveling on the thrust of one another.</p>

<p><strong>Fact</strong> Whenever a goose falls out of formation, it suddenly feels
the drag and resistance of trying to fly alone. It quickly gets back
into formation to take advantage of the lifting power of the bird
immediately in front of it.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson</strong> If we have as much sense as a goose, we will stay in
formation with those who are heeded where we want to go.</p>

<p><strong>Fact</strong> When the lead goose gets tired, it rotates back into the
formation and another goose flies at the point position.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson</strong> It pays to take turns doing the hard tasks and sharing the
leadership. People, as with geese, are interdependent on one another.</p>

<p><strong>Fact</strong> The geese in formation honk from behind to encourage those up
front to keep up their speed.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson</strong> We need to maker sure our “honking” from behind is
encouraging, not something less helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Fact</strong> When a goose gets sick or wounded or shot down, two geese
drop out of formation to follow it down and protect it. They stay with
the downed goose until it is either able to fly again or dies. Then
they launch out on their own with another formation or catch up with
their flock.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson</strong> If we have as much sense as geese, we will stand by one
another.</p>

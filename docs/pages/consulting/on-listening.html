<p>title: “On Listening”</p>

<p>A caveat in this article; I wrote this ages ago, at a time I was
pretty much incongnisant of neuroatypicality (and my own ablism about
it), and the inherent difficulty many people have with
communicating. If this make you feel put upon, or that this is
impossible for you, please don’t assume it applies to you personally.</p>

<p>I would appreciate input on this on how I can make it more
applicable, less ablist, and more broadly helpful for everyone. Hit me
up at the email on the left (or bottom if you’re on a phone).</p>

<hr />

<p>A story and an essay on listening</p>

<h2 id="first-a-story">First, a story:</h2>

<blockquote>
  <h3 id="because-we-dont-have-ear-lids">Because We Don’t Have Ear-Lids</h3>

  <p>Patricia Goldman, as vice chairperson of the National Transportation
Safety Board, used to tell a story about how poorly airline
passengers listen. She says that one flight attendant, who was
frustrated by passenger inattentiveness during her
what-to-do-in-an-emergency talk, changed the wording. This is what
she actually said:</p>

  <p>“When the mask drops down in front of you, place it over your naval
and continue to breathe normally.”</p>

  <p>Not a single passenger noticed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="on-listening">On Listening</h2>

<p>We have eyelids, but we do not have ear-lids. To compensate, we learn
to listen selectively – to turn our listening on and off. But if you
have ever been listened to, really listened to, you know how powerful
that experience is. You can likewise listen more effectively to others
by applying these four important listening principles.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Listen with your eyes. Make eye contact with the speaker. Learn to
concentrate on the moment at hand and clear your mind of
distractions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Listen with your ears. It is impossible to listen when you are
speaking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Listen with your mind. Let go of preconceived ideas about what you
THINK the speaker is saying. Keep your mind open, even if you
suspect you will dislike what you are about to hear. Stop thinking
about your response, be open to being pleasantly surprised and
discovering something new about the person you’re listening to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Listen with your heart. Be concerned for and genuinely interested in
the person to whom you are listening. That will speak louder than
anything you actually say.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Listening with your eyes, your ears, your mind and your heart is not
only effective, it will create an almost magical bond between you and
others that can be achieved in no other way. Dr. Karl Menninger
stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The
friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are
listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Often times, we think of conversations as give-and-take. What if you
just gave your attention to your counterpart, without waiting for a
chance to take?</p>

<p>We all need a friend who really listens. And we can all be one.</p>

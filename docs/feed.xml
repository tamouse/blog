        <title>Link: APOD: Electric Night</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The APOD image “Electric Night” captures my imagination in so many ways.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Link Collection</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s a dozen links of some stuff I’ve found interesting while perusing the web, twitter, fb, etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Cancel culture” has always existed — for the powerful, at least. Now, social media has democratized it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Link: W.E.B. DuBois' hand-drawn infographics of African American Life, from Public Domain Review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This link goes to an article in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://publicdomainreview.org/&quot;&gt;Public Domain Review&lt;/a&gt; and is from a few years back. (I can’t tell exactly because the article seems to be undated)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explanation:&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes it’s hard to decide which is more impressive – the land or the sky. On the land of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/DiegoRizzoPhoto/posts/2122092341173956&quot;&gt;featured image&lt;/a&gt;, for example, the Volcano of Fire (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volc%C3%A1n_de_Fuego&quot;&gt;Volcán de Fuego&lt;/a&gt;) is seen erupting topped by red-hot, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AQR8VQl-s&quot;&gt;wind-blown ash&lt;/a&gt; and with streams of glowing lava running down its side. Lights from neighboring towns are seen through a thin haze below. In the sky, though, the central plane of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way&quot;&gt;Milky Way Galaxy&lt;/a&gt; runs diagonally from the upper left, with a fleeting &lt;a href=&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181215.html&quot;&gt;meteor&lt;/a&gt; just below, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080604.html&quot;&gt;trail of a satellite&lt;/a&gt; to the upper right. The planet &lt;a href=&quot;https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/&quot;&gt;Jupiter&lt;/a&gt; also appears toward the upper left, with the bright star &lt;a href=&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180702.html&quot;&gt;Antares&lt;/a&gt; just to its right. Much of the land and the sky were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGh3cCmy5zg&quot;&gt;captured together in a single, well-timed, 25-second exposure&lt;/a&gt; taken in mid-April from the side of &lt;a href=&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150311.html&quot;&gt;Fuego&lt;/a&gt;’s sister volcano &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acatenango&quot;&gt;Acatenango&lt;/a&gt; in Guatemala. The image of the meteor, though, was captured in a similar frame taken about 30 minutes earlier – when the volanic eruption was not as photogenic – and added later digitally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>What is a Full-Stack Developer? A personal experience</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s been some controversy about the term “Full Stack Developer” recently. There was this image floating around for a while:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/5-minutes-to-go.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;drawing of a horse with a details back end and stick figure front end, labeled 'When there is 5 minutes to go on your test'. used to illustrate the dicongruity of the term 'full-stack developer'. popularized in a tweet by @holtbt&quot; title=&quot;5 minutes to go on the test&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand the concept. No one can be an expert in everything. No one should try. It makes sense to be deep in some area, and broad overall, but to expect any developer to be able to pick up anything on any given web app, software product, infrastructure project, etc, is a real &lt;strong&gt;management&lt;/strong&gt; fallacy, and that is a problem if that’s what your organization counts on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does that relate to me personally?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, at first I was offended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I think I’m filling in the detail on the entire horse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except, of course, I’m not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work is very much front-end these days. I write a lot of React code, and need to understand the triumverate of web programming languages JavaScript, HTML, and CSS very well. I have about 10 years experience of writing Ruby, especially in Rails, but also as a general-purpose lanaguge. Developing web apps also requires understanding of system and shell languages, as well as understanding how databases work and the languages associated with them. My practice has included working as a business analyst, to uncover users’ needs and translate them into actionable requirements for developers. I’ve worked in quality assurance, as an engineer, to develop processes that ensure customers and users get valuable and useful products. I’ve worked from deep in the guts of a unix kernel, writing device drivers, to the front of a dashboard control panel for network administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a generalist. But more important, I’m a problem solver. Sure, there’s no way I can solve every problem, but I can pretty much understand problems well enough to find out who can solve it, and understand how it fits into the whole. So what does that make me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; the term “full-stack” – it’s too &lt;em&gt;limiting&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m writing a React component, I’m deeply interested in how the user experience of it manifests in solving a problem for the user interacting with it. What task are they hoping to accomplish, and am I writing the version of this component that’s going to fulfill (part of) that task in the best way for the user?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m writing that, am I going to be able to interact with our services and databases without taxing them or costing us more in infrastructure and/or support system nightmares?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the specific area I work in, I’m using GraphQL, and there is no one else on the team who understands how to write a GraphQL API into our backend, so I do that as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does that make me? A unicorn? I don’t know if it does. We have a small dev team (just enlarged by 2 people, but then diminished by losing our tech lead / manager); we &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; need to work all over the app. Some specialize in specific knowledge, but we also need to share knowledge of the product so it doesn’t get lost &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; so people can review each other’s work. I’ve spent the past couple years as the primary front-end dev without anyone to bounce ideas off of, or give solid review feedback; the team is super supportive, but mainly it’s feedback like “Looks good to me!”, “We trust you!”, and so on; i.e., not &lt;em&gt;constructive&lt;/em&gt; even if quite supportive. For the first 6 months, another team mate was also newly working on the mobile app; we couldn’t even really give each other constructive feedback in that time. 2 years ago I wasn’t working on the front-end at all. No question my &lt;em&gt;breadth&lt;/em&gt; of experience over the years has let me make it through to here, but it hasn’t been &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;. So maybe this horse’s front end &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; just a stick figure. But it won’t stay that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do think there is space in this world for generalists, but I don’t think expecting such generalism to equate to being capable of all things anywhere in the product is doing anyone a service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m rapidly losing touch with our operations stuff; I used to work a lot with chef, puppet, and ansible, working to provisioning servers and deploy software fully configured. I don’t do that anymore, even necessarily with my own projects. Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery is something I use, but it’s not something I study anymore. There are lots of specific services the product integrates with that I know nothing about. Mobile development eludes me, and I just can’t seem to get the hang of it. Anything to do with specific operating systems other than Unix-based ones remains somewhat opaque. (When I have to use XCode, I don’t understand anything about what I’m looking at. I know a few buttons to push and that’s all.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t write any C code; I haven’t for years. It used to be my everyday language for a decade, at least. Same for PHP and Perl. Ruby has replaced them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still write Lisp, which was the 3rd language I ever learned, because, yay, emacs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most people starting out in their career, it’s really great to focus in, get depth in a discipline. It’s necessary to keep expanding beyond it, getting understanding of other disciplines, and there’s more in common than not in many cases. Learning new languaqes, especially languages for different disciplines, is helpful. The tools to build software these days are pretty phenomenal, and also require study to use well. Even your code editor, whether it’s vim/emacs, WebStorm, VSCode, Atom, or &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; (requisite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xkcd.com/378/&quot; title=&quot;_Real Programmers_ by Randall Munroe, who has something to say about ... nearly everything in my life&quot;&gt;xkcd reference&lt;/a&gt;) requires studying how it works, how it can help you write better code, faster, and more accurately, and be customized or tailored to fit your “hand”. (I’m an old emacser, and not a day goes by I’m not twiddling some setting or writing a snippet of elisp.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you label yourself a “Front-end Dev”, or a “Back-end Dev”, or a “Full-Stack Dev”, that’s absolutely great. I don’t believe there’s really a specific problem with labels; I think there can be problems when expectations are assumed because of the label, which is also inevitable. How important is how you label yourself to you? How long do you think you’ll keep it?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Improving our communication: A Tweet Thread and Discussion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, on twitter, a question came into my feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;original-tweet&quot;&gt;original tweet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The thing that interests me most professionally is communication. It&amp;#39;s so important because none of us work in a vacuum. But there&amp;#39;s no postmortem for a disappointing conversation and no whitepaper for getting someone to challenge bad assumptions. How do people get good at this?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; A Mind Forever Voyaging (@jbeallurks) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jbeallurks/status/1104421281762603009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 9, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-rest-of-the-conversation&quot;&gt;the rest of the conversation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@tamouse: are you trying to improve your communication or someone else’s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@jbeallurks: Mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@tamouse: what’s stopping you from doing a post-mortem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@tamouse: for the latter, google up “conversation for action” by terry winograd and fernando flores&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@jbeallurks: I’m really just not sure what that would look like. I don’t record or make transcripts of conversations, so going over what was said with another person would be tough. Any suggestions? It sounds like you have thoughts and I would like to hear them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@tamouse: do it immediately after when you can. as with any after analysis, it’s so easy to forget. take notes during when you can, box them on the paper to use some sort of mark to indicate something you want to review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@tamouse: also, before the conversation, if there is time to plan, write out you desired outcomes for it. you can also do this for the impromptu, drive-by conversations by having notes about what you’d want to discuss with someone when the opportunity arises&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@tamouse: there are so many books, courses, seminars, workshops, coaches, and so on out there on how to learn to improve one’s abilities to communicate. i was fortunate enough to work at a company that valued this enough to pay for my learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@jbeallurks: For sure. I’m going to expense a copy of Conversations for Action today. Thanks for the ideas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-wait-&quot;&gt;but wait …&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another poster had some good responses too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;You get good at it by being a human and being approachable. People only avoid “bad conversation post Mortem” if they’re scare or don’t want to bother approaching you because of the expected responses. Otherwise people aren’t typically shy about bad communication imho&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; idiot_girl (@idiot_girl) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/idiot_girl/status/1104531926067675137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 9, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the follow-on from that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@jbeallurks: Have you tried to analyze a conversation where you couldn’t persuade someone to do something to figure out how you could have done better? What does that look like for you? At my job, we do this for bugs and technical issues, but not for the human side of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@idiot_girl  So there’s no concept in your mind that maybe you were wrong for a reason you don’t understand which is why you couldn’t persuade someone to do the thing you wanted them to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;theres-more&quot;&gt;there’s more!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much lurking and unpacked in this brief twitalog that I thought it might be helpful (at least to me) to review my thoughts, and perhaps even model the behaviour I mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I picked up on in the original tweet from @jbeallurks is the desire to improve their understanding of what happened in a “disappointing conversation” (their words).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial question was to determine who they wanted to change - themself or another person. The response back indicating they wanted to change their own ability is at the surface seemingly &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; title=&quot;To be written&quot;&gt;ecological&lt;/a&gt;. But perhaps it wasn’t so much; poster @idiot_girl poses a question that might lead in a different direction. Holding off on that for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-how-to-communicate&quot;&gt;learning how to communicate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This subject is older than recorded history, and is the basis of all our culture. But it still seems like many of us treat it as an unlearnable, and even unteachable, subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so, there are at least hundreds of books that come out every year in this topic. Nearly every self-help book, guide, seminar, workshop, has improving communication as one of its underpinnings. The problem might be not that there is nothing to find, but that there is too much to pick from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communication is a skill, therefore it can be studied, taught, learned, practiced, and improved. It contains arts and sciences, subskills, situational aspects, and lots of other things that can be broken out, broken down into smaller chunks, learned, and practiced in the small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-suggestions&quot;&gt;some suggestions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;study it. I gave @jbeallurks the suggestion of looking up Terry Winograd and Fernando Flores’ “Conversation for Action” research. There’s a lot of it, and books published and seminars given, not just white papers. A lot of other work is based in part on this research as well. Thing is, you can even start with a google search of “how do i improve my communication” or “how do i become more persuasive” which might get to the OP’s initial desire. Or do a search on Amazon or Goodreads for titles about improving communications; I later offered a link on Amazon to the famous book by Dale Carnegie, “How to Win Friends and Influence People”. I don’t have an amazon affiliate, you can look it up. :D&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;write down your outcomes. This means figuring out what you want to get better at, but also what your outcomes for any particular conversation might be. In the case of bug review meetings, there should be ample time to write out the points you wish to make, why you think they’re important, and what risk might show up if unmitigated. In the case of casual hallway or ‘drive-by’ meetings, having a list of what the outcomes might be for such meetings written down ahead of time, perhaps by person you might encounter, can help you prepare or even rehearse such meetings. This is something David Allen talks about in “Getting Things Done” is keeping that list written down and out of your head during non-conversation times, and reviewing them later. The act of writing it down, and reviewing it periodically, can help in the moment when those impromptu situations arise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;take notes in meetings. Most folks these days feel they need to write into a computer to keep these notes, and that’s acutally the worst thing you can do. Take a notebook, any size, or a bunch of index cards with you into meetings, with a couple of pens, and  hand-write the notes. Keep them brief, but with enough info you can recall your thoughts afterwards. This accomplishes two things:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;it keeps track of points you want to review&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;it keeps your head in the meeting by getting the thoughts out of your head&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;when you’re in a space where taking notes might be impossible, use different techniques to remember, like inverting a ring, a watch, push a sleeve up, pull one down, etc. These are markers that remind your body something it up, so later you will remember.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;don’t believe that when you’re in an impromptu conversation that you automatically can’t take notes. Keep a bunch of 3x5 cards or sticky notes and a pen handy. (Another good reason for making pockets in women’s clothing.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;as soon as you can, review the conversation, do an After Analysis, or post-mortem, on what happened, what were the outcomes, what worked, what could have gone better, what you need to do differently to prepare for the next one, and so on. Don’t just do this for the disappointing conversations, do this for all the conversations; note that conversations that you walk away from feeling satisfied have at least as much to teach as looking at disappointing ones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;find a third party to discuss things with, one who has your improvement in communicating as their own goal might be best; it doesn’t have to be a boss, it can be a mentor, or hire a coach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;maybe-im-wrong&quot;&gt;“maybe I’m wrong”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing responder @idiot_girl very adroitly points out: What if &lt;em&gt;you’re&lt;/em&gt; wrong? What if it’s &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; assumptions that are bad? How would you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can’t see this, it might mean you need to work on your listening skills. Conversations, which meetings are a special form of, are about sharing information, learning things, moreso than telling things. If your intent is the latter, probably better to send a memo email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly there are times when you have information to provide to a conversation and it is important to participate in that way. If at the end you feel disappointed that you weren’t heard, there are avenues to follow up in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But do consider that you are as likely as anyone else attending to be holding incorrect assumptions, and the only way to find out is to surface your own and others’ assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a thing I noticed a lot when facilitating groups: that people holding opposing viewpoints on a topic often have unstated assumptions about the time frame they are discussing the problems in. The short term effects are quite often different than the long term effects, but until these time-frame assumptions are explored, the point remained unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learn-how-to-be-facilitative&quot;&gt;learn how to be facilitative&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things a lot of folks believe is that it’s necessary to convince someone else when are wrong, making bad assumptions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In @jbeallurks original post, they mention “getting someone to challenge bad assumptions”. Again the lament about no white papers being available is just wrong, there are tons of such things out in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the very premise might be wrong. Perhaps it’s not about convincing someone &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; to challenge bad assumptions, but the chance for you to step into helping the group understand the assumptions it may be making, laying bare some of the areas of disagreement, understanding, or even where folks actually agree on things but don’t realize it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not necessarily easy, especially when one has one’s own opinions that feel compelling. If your goal is have your opinions prevail, you’ll have less luck because you’ve already broken the first rule of communication, which is to listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I feel the role of playing facilitator comes in best: the facilitator’s &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; task is to listen and repeat back the group’s conversation. This helps all the members of the conversation hear what was said, and see if they can agree with it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Master facilitators will go further than this; they are also good at asking the group open-ended questions to help the group open up conversation and information flow. Beginners should stick to listening and repeating what they heard; learning to do this in a high-fidelity fashion is a skill in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most difficult aspect is putting aside one’s own beliefs and feelings, and approach the situation “agendaless” – in essence, to hold your own opinions and desires at bay, in order to forward the best possible outcome for the group. If you feel no one else can represent your point of view, this might not be the right time, but even in that case, it will help to listen and ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-conclusion&quot;&gt;no conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conversation is far from over, I haven’t spent enough words on listening, for example; I don’t feel there can really ever be enough said about communication :) .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly, I’d like to know what you think. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tamouse&quot;&gt;At-me on twitter&lt;/a&gt; and let’s talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Social Media has Eaten My Life</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The last several years have seen me swallowed up in the various social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Google-Plus, Instagram, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is the way my family shares pictures, news about ourselves, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is the way my friends share their goings on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is how I find news and information, and to hear the opinions by people I want to hear from on issues of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is sometimes a place to get inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But mostly, social media is merely a filler, something to page through when I’m not engaging my mind in some other pursuit. It is the windows solitaire of our day. And personally, it is getting out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;none-of-this-is-new-or-even-news-or-even-mildly-profound&quot;&gt;none of this is new, or even news, or even mildly profound&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before today’s social media, before Myspace, before Friendster, before livejournal, and even before the web, the way I communicated with people was through email. I used to subscribe to several different mailing lists of different topics that were interesting and important to me at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary difference to me between writing emails to a list (or longer-form blog posts like this) and posting on any particular SM platform is one of &lt;em&gt;length&lt;/em&gt;. A follow-on from that is that instead of writing into a tiny little text field, I would write into a regular text editor, as I am with this blog post. The differences are tremendous: while writing at length, I necessarily slow down my posting activity, spending more time composing, and &lt;em&gt;waaaayy&lt;/em&gt; more time editing, considering, and polishing my words. There will more than likely still be some typos and such, but far fewer missing entire words. I can press the enter key and all that happens is I get a new line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publishing these thoughts takes an additional step, or two or three, which is extremely antithetical to the pace seemingly required to keep up on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost is that people have to subscribe to my blog, or be on an email list with me, and it can lead to much greater obscurity. As well, the conversation is more difficult to establish and maintain since people need to spend more effort than clicking on a “Like” button, or typing a couple emoji in a reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is my own personal “kids these days” rant; I’ll cop to that. But social media is not serving my needs, and I feel my own abilities declining in the face of it. In addition, social media is so bloody easy to fall into, and it’s on every device I use, so I go to that because it’s also easier than getting out the sketchbook, setting up the watercolours, getting out with my camera and taking intentional photographs (vs. documenting things with is all I use my camera for these days).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, I have returned to pen and paper journaling, as well as keeping a notebook for software engineering. This was really only due to my falling in love with fountain pens, and extension of my now nearly non-existent sketching practice. I’m using journals to record things I learn, things I want to learn, ideas, quotes, and all those things I was trying to remember, but never getting around to actually thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-i-want-to-go&quot;&gt;where i want to go&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my goals for this 2019 year is to spend more time writing intentionally like this, and less time actually on social media. I intend to use social media to point to my writings, and hopefully the conversations can begin and continue. I want, overall, to live more of my life intentionally, and that is not something spending whole days scrolling and refreshing social media is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, this post is wholly stream of consciousness, but it is something I’ve been noodling over for at least the past year. The difficulty of not getting my thoughts off the back burner in my brain and out into the forefront has been an issue of not spending time intentionally. I suppose today I find myself a bit fed up with myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one can really hold me accountable to this except myself. I need to step back into some personal practices that have served me in the past, such as performing regular reviews, following a routine for starting and ending my day, taking more time for writing, both reflecting and planning. Putting together a longer term set of goals, and defining my purpose, now that I am in my 62nd year of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals-for-2019&quot;&gt;goals for 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;making meaningful progress towards defeating institutional racism, ablism, misogyny, classism, hatred, and oppression, to make marginalized people’s everyday lives and existence easier&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;increasing the opportunities and abilities for people to reach for those opportunities in tech and particularly in software engineering which is my own specialty&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to speak out, call out, and name white supremacy when I see it happening, most especially if I’m engaging in it&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to listen and learn from marginalized people, and forward their words&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>The Buddhist Metta of Lovingkindness (a repost)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Buddhist Metta of Loving Kindness has a long and rich tradition. It is brought into practice to keep the mind open and fruitful. It’s purpose is to develop a sense of selflessness and practice altruism, as was taught by the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic concept is that hatred cannot coexist with a sense of loving kindness; one drives out the other. So to practice giving loving kindness, one can dispell a sense of hatred. Loving kindness is not forgiveness, although they are somewhat related, and practicing loving kindness can lead one to forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many things which cause one to have negative states; practicing a positive state can help relieve one of those negative feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-method-of-the-prayer&quot;&gt;The Method of the Prayer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To perform this prayer, one must thing of other people, and make the prayer to them each in turn. Some of the people to think of include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yourself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your parents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your siblings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other relations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those you work with and for&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those you play with&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those you are in community with&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those who give you guidance and support&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those who contest with you&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those who might be your enemies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The entire world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this goes from small to huge. How does one possibly think of the entire world? Actually, it isn’t necessarily that difficult a thing to conceptualize that all people everywhere can benefit from loving kindness. Perhaps a more difficult set of people to think of this way are your supposed enemies. How can you justify wishing loving kindness for them? Yet this is the way of achieving true detachment and grace, and to achieve a truly loving, kind heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, recite the metta substituting the person or people or group for the tag &amp;lt;person&amp;gt; in the script below. Start from the center, yourself, and work your way out to the last group “all beings”, the reverse the flow back to yourself. You may speak it to individuals, groups, or whatever you wish that signifies the recipient of your loving kindness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-metta&quot;&gt;The Metta&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May &amp;lt;person&amp;gt; have happiness, and the causes of happiness &lt;br /&gt;
May &amp;lt;person&amp;gt; be free from suffering, and the causes of suffering &lt;br /&gt;
May &amp;lt;person&amp;gt; never be separated, from the supreme joy that is beyond all sorrow &lt;br /&gt;
May &amp;lt;person&amp;gt; abide in equanimity, free from attachment and aversion &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;another-version&quot;&gt;Another Version&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May &amp;lt;person&amp;gt; live in safety. &lt;br /&gt;
May &amp;lt;person&amp;gt; be happy. &lt;br /&gt;
May &amp;lt;person&amp;gt; be healthy. &lt;br /&gt;
May &amp;lt;person&amp;gt; live with ease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tweet thread: Anti-racism 101, by @vogelbeere</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A great &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vogelbeere/status/1032252835130306560&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; about racism, and anti-racism, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vogelbeere&quot;&gt;@vogelbeere&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Anti-racism 101. A thread.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Yvonne Aburrow (@vogelbeere) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vogelbeere/status/1032049568345509894?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 21, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Anti-racism 101. A thread.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#1. If a BIPOC person criticizes whiteness or white people, they’re talking about the construct of whiteness, white supremacy, white supremacist behaviour &amp;amp; institutions. If you &amp;amp; others don’t do the thing described, DO NOT go “not all white people”. They know it’s not all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#2. Systemic racism. The institutions (e.g. police, law courts, schools), behaviours, societal assumptions, discrimination, lack of representation in media, stereotypes, and other systems that oppress BIPOC people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#3. Micro aggressions. The constant drip drip of racist behaviour that a BIPOC person experiences in a day, e.g. a white woman on a bus clutches her purse tightly on seeing a Black man. Small in itself but multiplied up by hundreds in a day, extremely wearing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#4. NO YOU CANNOT EVER TOUCH BIPOC PEOPLE’S HAIR, nor hijabs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#5. White privilege. If you are white, you may have had many disadvantages in your life, but none of them were caused by the colour of your skin.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#6. Blood quantum. Never ask an Indigenous person what percentage Native they are. You belong to the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis by being a recognized member of the culture.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#7. Cultural appropriation. The use of cultural rituals &amp;amp; artifacts by a culture that oppressed &amp;amp; colonized the culture whose rituals &amp;amp; artifacts are being appropriated, especially if it involves pretending to be a member of that culture or making money out of pretending to be.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#8. Tone policing. Don’t say “if you weren’t so angry/aggressive/rude, I would support your cause”. BIPOC and other oppressed groups have every right to be angry about being oppressed and to express their anger.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#9. Land acknowledgement (Canada, USA, NZ, Aus). Learn the land acknowledgement for your area and the history of the Indigenous peoples whose land you are on. Be respectful. Support their struggle for land rights &amp;amp; self-determination.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#10. Don’t talk over BIPOC people. Listen to what they say, signal-boost,  and don’t reply to threads that are specifically asking for BIPOC views on a topic. Don’t assume you know better than they do about their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#11. Learn about residential schools, the treaty process, the history of struggle for land rights, civil rights, education etc. Don’t stop listening and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#12. If you screw up (and you will) apologize, make amends if possible, learn from your mistake. (Do not double down and make it worse.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#13. If you are unfamiliar with the terms in this tweet thread, or a term used by a BIPOC person, google it. It is not the responsibility of the oppressed to educate the oppressors. There are zillions of good articles out there on the interwebs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If I’ve missed anything from this list, feel free to add it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\14. Vegans! Do not shout at Indigenous people/s for hunting. They hunt sustainably and humanely. Also 80% of the most biodiverse land on Earth is managed and/or owned by Indigenous peoples.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Go shout at industrialized factory farming instead.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\15. Satire punches up at the oppressor, not down at the oppressed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\16. Both Islamophobia and anti-Semitism are forms of racism. OK so Islam is a religion not a race, but the motivation behind Islamophobia is racist.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\17. If you’re at a powwow, read the rules of respectful behaviour which are printed in the program, and abide by them. In case there isn’t a program, here’s a list from the Six Nations: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DlK0zFnUUAEgw42.jpg&quot;&gt;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DlK0zFnUUAEgw42.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\18. We live immersed in a racist society &amp;amp; racist discourse. So however anti-racist you are, you could still be harbouring racist attitudes &amp;amp; biases that you’re unaware of. Hence we need to examine our biases &amp;amp; question our assumptions. This is not guilt tripping, it’s awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\20. Intersectionality. Term coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw to describe intersecting oppressions. Originally used to describe the way Black women are oppressed both asBlack and as women and these oppressions intersect.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\21. Anti-racist social media etiquette. Don’t tag BIPOC people to call their attention to some obnoxious racist nonsense. They see enough of that without you dragging them into more of it. Tag @ nowhitenonsense instead. (White nonsense roundup)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\22. If you reply to a troll attacking a BIPOC person, just reply to the troll &amp;amp; not the BIPOC person; again this saves them a lot of aggro. Always report the troll to Twitter/FB. Although Twitter often says the troll is not violating the terms of service, it’s still worth doing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\23. A white supremacist society is one that’s organized for the benefit of white people. White supremacy as an ideology is the assumption that white people are better than everyone else. White supremacist societies don’t happen by accident, they’re driven by that ideology.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\24. Don’t assume that BIPOC want to talk about racism, land rights, etc (even if it’s an obsession for you because you just became aware).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\25. Don’t assume that any given BIPOC person is representative of their whole ethnic group, cultural group, or religion&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\26. Race is a social construct, but like gender, has real effects. Whiteness was invented/constructed in order to divide working class people. It assimilated various ethnic groups (Southern European, Eastern Europeans, and Jewish people were not originally seen as white.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\27. White fragility. When a white person has a meltdown because a racist thing (systemic or personal) is pointed out to them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\28. White tears. When a white person (usually a woman) bursts into tears when their Black friend describes systemic racism to them: not crying because of the injustice but because “oh you must hate me now”. (Ugh, was so horrified when I found out this was a thing.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\29. White tears, weaponised version: when a white woman cries about something a Black man has allegedly done to her, and bad stuff happens as a result. Really horrific stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\30. The unmarked default. A category of people that is regarded as the norm, therefore it doesn’t need a label — e.g. white, cisgender, heterosexual are all regarded as the unmarked default by some people in those categories and they have a hissy fit if they get labelled.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\31. Black names. Black people are recovering from centuries of oppression &amp;amp; if they choose unusual names that’s their right to assert their own culture in the face of continuing oppression.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\32. Indigenous names. Learn the proper name of Indigenous peoples and places (at least your local ones) rather than the English name. Examples: Mohawk = Kanienke:ha
Six Nations = Haudenosaunee
Lake Erie = Erielhonan&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\33. Names of other ethnic groups. Don’t say “what a weird name” when introduced to your PoC colleague or friend of a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\34. Don’t ask where someone’s from (or even worse, “where are you really from” — Accept the first answer they give). Wait to be told, or (if appropriate) ask where their accent is from, or what their heritage is. If in doubt, don’t ask.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\35. “Political correctness” was invented by the right as a stick to beat the left with. What anti-racists actually say is, let’s treat others respectfully. We never use the phrase “political correctness”. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dowsingfordivinity.wordpress.com/2016/08/20/5109/&quot;&gt;https://dowsingfordivinity.wordpress.com/2016/08/20/5109/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\36. If a BIPOC person relates something that happened to them, i.e. personal experience, don’t reply with statistics or generalizations or “well that’s never happened to me so it can’t be real”. If it happened, it happened. And if they regard it as racist, it was racist.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\37. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/UNDRIP?src=hash&quot;&gt;#UNDRIP&lt;/a&gt;. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. (2007) enshrines the right to self-determination and land title for Indigenous peoples.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\38. First Nations in Canada have control and use of 0.2% of the land. That’s a statistic from the government of Canada. (It doesn’t include Nunavut, afaik.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The standard of living in Canada is number 1 in the world. Standard of living for Indigenous peoples, 78th in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\39. Some Indigenous people (“status Indians”) are federally funded. This means they get much less funding per person than the rest of Canada, e.g. monthly welfare for Indigenous person, 2017: $138. Monthly welfare for unemployed Canadians, 2016: $733 (approximately).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\40. Just because you know one BIPOC person who doesn’t object to something that every other BIPOC person finds problematic (e.g. sports teams with dodgy names) doesn’t mean it isn’t a problem. If the majority of BIPOC people think something is objectionable or problematic, it is.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\41. “Mixed race”. There’s only one race, the human race. A person with parents of different colours is mixed heritage &amp;amp; their parents came from 2 different cultures, e.g. a person who is half Mikmaq and half Scottish has two cultures. (cf Métis — a merger of cultures, not genes)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\42. (The answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything): DON’T BE A DICK.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you liked this thread, go read lots of anti-racist articles for more nuance than is possible in a tweet thread.&lt;/p&gt;

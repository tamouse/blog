&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explanation:&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes it’s hard to decide which is more impressive – the land or the sky. On the land of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/DiegoRizzoPhoto/posts/2122092341173956&quot;&gt;featured image&lt;/a&gt;, for example, the Volcano of Fire (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volc%C3%A1n_de_Fuego&quot;&gt;Volcán de Fuego&lt;/a&gt;) is seen erupting topped by red-hot, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AQR8VQl-s&quot;&gt;wind-blown ash&lt;/a&gt; and with streams of glowing lava running down its side. Lights from neighboring towns are seen through a thin haze below. In the sky, though, the central plane of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way&quot;&gt;Milky Way Galaxy&lt;/a&gt; runs diagonally from the upper left, with a fleeting &lt;a href=&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap181215.html&quot;&gt;meteor&lt;/a&gt; just below, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080604.html&quot;&gt;trail of a satellite&lt;/a&gt; to the upper right. The planet &lt;a href=&quot;https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/&quot;&gt;Jupiter&lt;/a&gt; also appears toward the upper left, with the bright star &lt;a href=&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180702.html&quot;&gt;Antares&lt;/a&gt; just to its right. Much of the land and the sky were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGh3cCmy5zg&quot;&gt;captured together in a single, well-timed, 25-second exposure&lt;/a&gt; taken in mid-April from the side of &lt;a href=&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap150311.html&quot;&gt;Fuego&lt;/a&gt;’s sister volcano &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acatenango&quot;&gt;Acatenango&lt;/a&gt; in Guatemala. The image of the meteor, though, was captured in a similar frame taken about 30 minutes earlier – when the volanic eruption was not as photogenic – and added later digitally.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What is a Full-Stack Developer? A personal experience</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s been some controversy about the term “Full Stack Developer” recently. There was this image floating around for a while:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/5-minutes-to-go.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;drawing of a horse with a details back end and stick figure front end, labeled 'When there is 5 minutes to go on your test'. used to illustrate the dicongruity of the term 'full-stack developer'. popularized in a tweet by @holtbt&quot; title=&quot;5 minutes to go on the test&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand the concept. No one can be an expert in everything. No one should try. It makes sense to be deep in some area, and broad overall, but to expect any developer to be able to pick up anything on any given web app, software product, infrastructure project, etc, is a real &lt;strong&gt;management&lt;/strong&gt; fallacy, and that is a problem if that’s what your organization counts on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does that relate to me personally?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, at first I was offended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I think I’m filling in the detail on the entire horse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except, of course, I’m not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work is very much front-end these days. I write a lot of React code, and need to understand the triumverate of web programming languages JavaScript, HTML, and CSS very well. I have about 10 years experience of writing Ruby, especially in Rails, but also as a general-purpose lanaguge. Developing web apps also requires understanding of system and shell languages, as well as understanding how databases work and the languages associated with them. My practice has included working as a business analyst, to uncover users’ needs and translate them into actionable requirements for developers. I’ve worked in quality assurance, as an engineer, to develop processes that ensure customers and users get valuable and useful products. I’ve worked from deep in the guts of a unix kernel, writing device drivers, to the front of a dashboard control panel for network administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a generalist. But more important, I’m a problem solver. Sure, there’s no way I can solve every problem, but I can pretty much understand problems well enough to find out who can solve it, and understand how it fits into the whole. So what does that make me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; the term “full-stack” – it’s too &lt;em&gt;limiting&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m writing a React component, I’m deeply interested in how the user experience of it manifests in solving a problem for the user interacting with it. What task are they hoping to accomplish, and am I writing the version of this component that’s going to fulfill (part of) that task in the best way for the user?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m writing that, am I going to be able to interact with our services and databases without taxing them or costing us more in infrastructure and/or support system nightmares?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the specific area I work in, I’m using GraphQL, and there is no one else on the team who understands how to write a GraphQL API into our backend, so I do that as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does that make me? A unicorn? I don’t know if it does. We have a small dev team (just enlarged by 2 people, but then diminished by losing our tech lead / manager); we &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; need to work all over the app. Some specialize in specific knowledge, but we also need to share knowledge of the product so it doesn’t get lost &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; so people can review each other’s work. I’ve spent the past couple years as the primary front-end dev without anyone to bounce ideas off of, or give solid review feedback; the team is super supportive, but mainly it’s feedback like “Looks good to me!”, “We trust you!”, and so on; i.e., not &lt;em&gt;constructive&lt;/em&gt; even if quite supportive. For the first 6 months, another team mate was also newly working on the mobile app; we couldn’t even really give each other constructive feedback in that time. 2 years ago I wasn’t working on the front-end at all. No question my &lt;em&gt;breadth&lt;/em&gt; of experience over the years has let me make it through to here, but it hasn’t been &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;. So maybe this horse’s front end &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; just a stick figure. But it won’t stay that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do think there is space in this world for generalists, but I don’t think expecting such generalism to equate to being capable of all things anywhere in the product is doing anyone a service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m rapidly losing touch with our operations stuff; I used to work a lot with chef, puppet, and ansible, working to provisioning servers and deploy software fully configured. I don’t do that anymore, even necessarily with my own projects. Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery is something I use, but it’s not something I study anymore. There are lots of specific services the product integrates with that I know nothing about. Mobile development eludes me, and I just can’t seem to get the hang of it. Anything to do with specific operating systems other than Unix-based ones remains somewhat opaque. (When I have to use XCode, I don’t understand anything about what I’m looking at. I know a few buttons to push and that’s all.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t write any C code; I haven’t for years. It used to be my everyday language for a decade, at least. Same for PHP and Perl. Ruby has replaced them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still write Lisp, which was the 3rd language I ever learned, because, yay, emacs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most people starting out in their career, it’s really great to focus in, get depth in a discipline. It’s necessary to keep expanding beyond it, getting understanding of other disciplines, and there’s more in common than not in many cases. Learning new languaqes, especially languages for different disciplines, is helpful. The tools to build software these days are pretty phenomenal, and also require study to use well. Even your code editor, whether it’s vim/emacs, WebStorm, VSCode, Atom, or &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; (requisite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xkcd.com/378/&quot; title=&quot;_Real Programmers_ by Randall Munroe, who has something to say about ... nearly everything in my life&quot;&gt;xkcd reference&lt;/a&gt;) requires studying how it works, how it can help you write better code, faster, and more accurately, and be customized or tailored to fit your “hand”. (I’m an old emacser, and not a day goes by I’m not twiddling some setting or writing a snippet of elisp.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you label yourself a “Front-end Dev”, or a “Back-end Dev”, or a “Full-Stack Dev”, that’s absolutely great. I don’t believe there’s really a specific problem with labels; I think there can be problems when expectations are assumed because of the label, which is also inevitable. How important is how you label yourself to you? How long do you think you’ll keep it?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Improving our communication: A Tweet Thread and Discussion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, on twitter, a question came into my feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;original-tweet&quot;&gt;original tweet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The thing that interests me most professionally is communication. It&amp;#39;s so important because none of us work in a vacuum. But there&amp;#39;s no postmortem for a disappointing conversation and no whitepaper for getting someone to challenge bad assumptions. How do people get good at this?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; A Mind Forever Voyaging (@jbeallurks) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jbeallurks/status/1104421281762603009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 9, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-rest-of-the-conversation&quot;&gt;the rest of the conversation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@tamouse: are you trying to improve your communication or someone else’s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@jbeallurks: Mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@tamouse: what’s stopping you from doing a post-mortem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@tamouse: for the latter, google up “conversation for action” by terry winograd and fernando flores&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@jbeallurks: I’m really just not sure what that would look like. I don’t record or make transcripts of conversations, so going over what was said with another person would be tough. Any suggestions? It sounds like you have thoughts and I would like to hear them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@tamouse: do it immediately after when you can. as with any after analysis, it’s so easy to forget. take notes during when you can, box them on the paper to use some sort of mark to indicate something you want to review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@tamouse: also, before the conversation, if there is time to plan, write out you desired outcomes for it. you can also do this for the impromptu, drive-by conversations by having notes about what you’d want to discuss with someone when the opportunity arises&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@tamouse: there are so many books, courses, seminars, workshops, coaches, and so on out there on how to learn to improve one’s abilities to communicate. i was fortunate enough to work at a company that valued this enough to pay for my learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@jbeallurks: For sure. I’m going to expense a copy of Conversations for Action today. Thanks for the ideas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-wait-&quot;&gt;but wait …&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another poster had some good responses too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;You get good at it by being a human and being approachable. People only avoid “bad conversation post Mortem” if they’re scare or don’t want to bother approaching you because of the expected responses. Otherwise people aren’t typically shy about bad communication imho&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; idiot_girl (@idiot_girl) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/idiot_girl/status/1104531926067675137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 9, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the follow-on from that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@jbeallurks: Have you tried to analyze a conversation where you couldn’t persuade someone to do something to figure out how you could have done better? What does that look like for you? At my job, we do this for bugs and technical issues, but not for the human side of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;@idiot_girl  So there’s no concept in your mind that maybe you were wrong for a reason you don’t understand which is why you couldn’t persuade someone to do the thing you wanted them to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;theres-more&quot;&gt;there’s more!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much lurking and unpacked in this brief twitalog that I thought it might be helpful (at least to me) to review my thoughts, and perhaps even model the behaviour I mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I picked up on in the original tweet from @jbeallurks is the desire to improve their understanding of what happened in a “disappointing conversation” (their words).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial question was to determine who they wanted to change - themself or another person. The response back indicating they wanted to change their own ability is at the surface seemingly &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; title=&quot;To be written&quot;&gt;ecological&lt;/a&gt;. But perhaps it wasn’t so much; poster @idiot_girl poses a question that might lead in a different direction. Holding off on that for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-how-to-communicate&quot;&gt;learning how to communicate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This subject is older than recorded history, and is the basis of all our culture. But it still seems like many of us treat it as an unlearnable, and even unteachable, subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so, there are at least hundreds of books that come out every year in this topic. Nearly every self-help book, guide, seminar, workshop, has improving communication as one of its underpinnings. The problem might be not that there is nothing to find, but that there is too much to pick from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communication is a skill, therefore it can be studied, taught, learned, practiced, and improved. It contains arts and sciences, subskills, situational aspects, and lots of other things that can be broken out, broken down into smaller chunks, learned, and practiced in the small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-suggestions&quot;&gt;some suggestions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;study it. I gave @jbeallurks the suggestion of looking up Terry Winograd and Fernando Flores’ “Conversation for Action” research. There’s a lot of it, and books published and seminars given, not just white papers. A lot of other work is based in part on this research as well. Thing is, you can even start with a google search of “how do i improve my communication” or “how do i become more persuasive” which might get to the OP’s initial desire. Or do a search on Amazon or Goodreads for titles about improving communications; I later offered a link on Amazon to the famous book by Dale Carnegie, “How to Win Friends and Influence People”. I don’t have an amazon affiliate, you can look it up. :D&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;write down your outcomes. This means figuring out what you want to get better at, but also what your outcomes for any particular conversation might be. In the case of bug review meetings, there should be ample time to write out the points you wish to make, why you think they’re important, and what risk might show up if unmitigated. In the case of casual hallway or ‘drive-by’ meetings, having a list of what the outcomes might be for such meetings written down ahead of time, perhaps by person you might encounter, can help you prepare or even rehearse such meetings. This is something David Allen talks about in “Getting Things Done” is keeping that list written down and out of your head during non-conversation times, and reviewing them later. The act of writing it down, and reviewing it periodically, can help in the moment when those impromptu situations arise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;take notes in meetings. Most folks these days feel they need to write into a computer to keep these notes, and that’s acutally the worst thing you can do. Take a notebook, any size, or a bunch of index cards with you into meetings, with a couple of pens, and  hand-write the notes. Keep them brief, but with enough info you can recall your thoughts afterwards. This accomplishes two things:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;it keeps track of points you want to review&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;it keeps your head in the meeting by getting the thoughts out of your head&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;when you’re in a space where taking notes might be impossible, use different techniques to remember, like inverting a ring, a watch, push a sleeve up, pull one down, etc. These are markers that remind your body something it up, so later you will remember.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;don’t believe that when you’re in an impromptu conversation that you automatically can’t take notes. Keep a bunch of 3x5 cards or sticky notes and a pen handy. (Another good reason for making pockets in women’s clothing.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;as soon as you can, review the conversation, do an After Analysis, or post-mortem, on what happened, what were the outcomes, what worked, what could have gone better, what you need to do differently to prepare for the next one, and so on. Don’t just do this for the disappointing conversations, do this for all the conversations; note that conversations that you walk away from feeling satisfied have at least as much to teach as looking at disappointing ones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;find a third party to discuss things with, one who has your improvement in communicating as their own goal might be best; it doesn’t have to be a boss, it can be a mentor, or hire a coach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;maybe-im-wrong&quot;&gt;“maybe I’m wrong”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing responder @idiot_girl very adroitly points out: What if &lt;em&gt;you’re&lt;/em&gt; wrong? What if it’s &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; assumptions that are bad? How would you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can’t see this, it might mean you need to work on your listening skills. Conversations, which meetings are a special form of, are about sharing information, learning things, moreso than telling things. If your intent is the latter, probably better to send a memo email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly there are times when you have information to provide to a conversation and it is important to participate in that way. If at the end you feel disappointed that you weren’t heard, there are avenues to follow up in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But do consider that you are as likely as anyone else attending to be holding incorrect assumptions, and the only way to find out is to surface your own and others’ assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a thing I noticed a lot when facilitating groups: that people holding opposing viewpoints on a topic often have unstated assumptions about the time frame they are discussing the problems in. The short term effects are quite often different than the long term effects, but until these time-frame assumptions are explored, the point remained unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learn-how-to-be-facilitative&quot;&gt;learn how to be facilitative&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things a lot of folks believe is that it’s necessary to convince someone else when are wrong, making bad assumptions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In @jbeallurks original post, they mention “getting someone to challenge bad assumptions”. Again the lament about no white papers being available is just wrong, there are tons of such things out in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the very premise might be wrong. Perhaps it’s not about convincing someone &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; to challenge bad assumptions, but the chance for you to step into helping the group understand the assumptions it may be making, laying bare some of the areas of disagreement, understanding, or even where folks actually agree on things but don’t realize it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not necessarily easy, especially when one has one’s own opinions that feel compelling. If your goal is have your opinions prevail, you’ll have less luck because you’ve already broken the first rule of communication, which is to listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I feel the role of playing facilitator comes in best: the facilitator’s &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; task is to listen and repeat back the group’s conversation. This helps all the members of the conversation hear what was said, and see if they can agree with it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Master facilitators will go further than this; they are also good at asking the group open-ended questions to help the group open up conversation and information flow. Beginners should stick to listening and repeating what they heard; learning to do this in a high-fidelity fashion is a skill in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most difficult aspect is putting aside one’s own beliefs and feelings, and approach the situation “agendaless” – in essence, to hold your own opinions and desires at bay, in order to forward the best possible outcome for the group. If you feel no one else can represent your point of view, this might not be the right time, but even in that case, it will help to listen and ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-conclusion&quot;&gt;no conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conversation is far from over, I haven’t spent enough words on listening, for example; I don’t feel there can really ever be enough said about communication :) .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly, I’d like to know what you think. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tamouse&quot;&gt;At-me on twitter&lt;/a&gt; and let’s talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Social Media has Eaten My Life</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The last several years have seen me swallowed up in the various social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Google-Plus, Instagram, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is the way my family shares pictures, news about ourselves, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is the way my friends share their goings on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is how I find news and information, and to hear the opinions by people I want to hear from on issues of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is sometimes a place to get inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But mostly, social media is merely a filler, something to page through when I’m not engaging my mind in some other pursuit. It is the windows solitaire of our day. And personally, it is getting out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;none-of-this-is-new-or-even-news-or-even-mildly-profound&quot;&gt;none of this is new, or even news, or even mildly profound&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before today’s social media, before Myspace, before Friendster, before livejournal, and even before the web, the way I communicated with people was through email. I used to subscribe to several different mailing lists of different topics that were interesting and important to me at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary difference to me between writing emails to a list (or longer-form blog posts like this) and posting on any particular SM platform is one of &lt;em&gt;length&lt;/em&gt;. A follow-on from that is that instead of writing into a tiny little text field, I would write into a regular text editor, as I am with this blog post. The differences are tremendous: while writing at length, I necessarily slow down my posting activity, spending more time composing, and &lt;em&gt;waaaayy&lt;/em&gt; more time editing, considering, and polishing my words. There will more than likely still be some typos and such, but far fewer missing entire words. I can press the enter key and all that happens is I get a new line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publishing these thoughts takes an additional step, or two or three, which is extremely antithetical to the pace seemingly required to keep up on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost is that people have to subscribe to my blog, or be on an email list with me, and it can lead to much greater obscurity. As well, the conversation is more difficult to establish and maintain since people need to spend more effort than clicking on a “Like” button, or typing a couple emoji in a reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is my own personal “kids these days” rant; I’ll cop to that. But social media is not serving my needs, and I feel my own abilities declining in the face of it. In addition, social media is so bloody easy to fall into, and it’s on every device I use, so I go to that because it’s also easier than getting out the sketchbook, setting up the watercolours, getting out with my camera and taking intentional photographs (vs. documenting things with is all I use my camera for these days).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, I have returned to pen and paper journaling, as well as keeping a notebook for software engineering. This was really only due to my falling in love with fountain pens, and extension of my now nearly non-existent sketching practice. I’m using journals to record things I learn, things I want to learn, ideas, quotes, and all those things I was trying to remember, but never getting around to actually thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-i-want-to-go&quot;&gt;where i want to go&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my goals for this 2019 year is to spend more time writing intentionally like this, and less time actually on social media. I intend to use social media to point to my writings, and hopefully the conversations can begin and continue. I want, overall, to live more of my life intentionally, and that is not something spending whole days scrolling and refreshing social media is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, this post is wholly stream of consciousness, but it is something I’ve been noodling over for at least the past year. The difficulty of not getting my thoughts off the back burner in my brain and out into the forefront has been an issue of not spending time intentionally. I suppose today I find myself a bit fed up with myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one can really hold me accountable to this except myself. I need to step back into some personal practices that have served me in the past, such as performing regular reviews, following a routine for starting and ending my day, taking more time for writing, both reflecting and planning. Putting together a longer term set of goals, and defining my purpose, now that I am in my 62nd year of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals-for-2019&quot;&gt;goals for 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;making meaningful progress towards defeating institutional racism, ablism, misogyny, classism, hatred, and oppression, to make marginalized people’s everyday lives and existence easier&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;increasing the opportunities and abilities for people to reach for those opportunities in tech and particularly in software engineering which is my own specialty&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to speak out, call out, and name white supremacy when I see it happening, most especially if I’m engaging in it&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to listen and learn from marginalized people, and forward their words&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>The Buddhist Metta of Lovingkindness (a repost)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Buddhist Metta of Loving Kindness has a long and rich tradition. It is brought into practice to keep the mind open and fruitful. It’s purpose is to develop a sense of selflessness and practice altruism, as was taught by the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic concept is that hatred cannot coexist with a sense of loving kindness; one drives out the other. So to practice giving loving kindness, one can dispell a sense of hatred. Loving kindness is not forgiveness, although they are somewhat related, and practicing loving kindness can lead one to forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many things which cause one to have negative states; practicing a positive state can help relieve one of those negative feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-method-of-the-prayer&quot;&gt;The Method of the Prayer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To perform this prayer, one must thing of other people, and make the prayer to them each in turn. Some of the people to think of include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yourself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your parents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your siblings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other relations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those you work with and for&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those you play with&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those you are in community with&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those who give you guidance and support&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those who contest with you&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those who might be your enemies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The entire world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this goes from small to huge. How does one possibly think of the entire world? Actually, it isn’t necessarily that difficult a thing to conceptualize that all people everywhere can benefit from loving kindness. Perhaps a more difficult set of people to think of this way are your supposed enemies. How can you justify wishing loving kindness for them? Yet this is the way of achieving true detachment and grace, and to achieve a truly loving, kind heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, recite the metta substituting the person or people or group for the tag &amp;lt;person&amp;gt; in the script below. Start from the center, yourself, and work your way out to the last group “all beings”, the reverse the flow back to yourself. You may speak it to individuals, groups, or whatever you wish that signifies the recipient of your loving kindness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-metta&quot;&gt;The Metta&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May &amp;lt;person&amp;gt; have happiness, and the causes of happiness &lt;br /&gt;
May &amp;lt;person&amp;gt; be free from suffering, and the causes of suffering &lt;br /&gt;
May &amp;lt;person&amp;gt; never be separated, from the supreme joy that is beyond all sorrow &lt;br /&gt;
May &amp;lt;person&amp;gt; abide in equanimity, free from attachment and aversion &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;another-version&quot;&gt;Another Version&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May &amp;lt;person&amp;gt; live in safety. &lt;br /&gt;
May &amp;lt;person&amp;gt; be happy. &lt;br /&gt;
May &amp;lt;person&amp;gt; be healthy. &lt;br /&gt;
May &amp;lt;person&amp;gt; live with ease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tweet thread: Anti-racism 101, by @vogelbeere</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A great &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vogelbeere/status/1032252835130306560&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; about racism, and anti-racism, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vogelbeere&quot;&gt;@vogelbeere&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Anti-racism 101. A thread.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Yvonne Aburrow (@vogelbeere) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vogelbeere/status/1032049568345509894?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 21, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Anti-racism 101. A thread.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#1. If a BIPOC person criticizes whiteness or white people, they’re talking about the construct of whiteness, white supremacy, white supremacist behaviour &amp;amp; institutions. If you &amp;amp; others don’t do the thing described, DO NOT go “not all white people”. They know it’s not all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#2. Systemic racism. The institutions (e.g. police, law courts, schools), behaviours, societal assumptions, discrimination, lack of representation in media, stereotypes, and other systems that oppress BIPOC people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#3. Micro aggressions. The constant drip drip of racist behaviour that a BIPOC person experiences in a day, e.g. a white woman on a bus clutches her purse tightly on seeing a Black man. Small in itself but multiplied up by hundreds in a day, extremely wearing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#4. NO YOU CANNOT EVER TOUCH BIPOC PEOPLE’S HAIR, nor hijabs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#5. White privilege. If you are white, you may have had many disadvantages in your life, but none of them were caused by the colour of your skin.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#6. Blood quantum. Never ask an Indigenous person what percentage Native they are. You belong to the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis by being a recognized member of the culture.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#7. Cultural appropriation. The use of cultural rituals &amp;amp; artifacts by a culture that oppressed &amp;amp; colonized the culture whose rituals &amp;amp; artifacts are being appropriated, especially if it involves pretending to be a member of that culture or making money out of pretending to be.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#8. Tone policing. Don’t say “if you weren’t so angry/aggressive/rude, I would support your cause”. BIPOC and other oppressed groups have every right to be angry about being oppressed and to express their anger.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#9. Land acknowledgement (Canada, USA, NZ, Aus). Learn the land acknowledgement for your area and the history of the Indigenous peoples whose land you are on. Be respectful. Support their struggle for land rights &amp;amp; self-determination.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#10. Don’t talk over BIPOC people. Listen to what they say, signal-boost,  and don’t reply to threads that are specifically asking for BIPOC views on a topic. Don’t assume you know better than they do about their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#11. Learn about residential schools, the treaty process, the history of struggle for land rights, civil rights, education etc. Don’t stop listening and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#12. If you screw up (and you will) apologize, make amends if possible, learn from your mistake. (Do not double down and make it worse.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#13. If you are unfamiliar with the terms in this tweet thread, or a term used by a BIPOC person, google it. It is not the responsibility of the oppressed to educate the oppressors. There are zillions of good articles out there on the interwebs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If I’ve missed anything from this list, feel free to add it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\14. Vegans! Do not shout at Indigenous people/s for hunting. They hunt sustainably and humanely. Also 80% of the most biodiverse land on Earth is managed and/or owned by Indigenous peoples.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Go shout at industrialized factory farming instead.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\15. Satire punches up at the oppressor, not down at the oppressed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\16. Both Islamophobia and anti-Semitism are forms of racism. OK so Islam is a religion not a race, but the motivation behind Islamophobia is racist.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\17. If you’re at a powwow, read the rules of respectful behaviour which are printed in the program, and abide by them. In case there isn’t a program, here’s a list from the Six Nations: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DlK0zFnUUAEgw42.jpg&quot;&gt;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DlK0zFnUUAEgw42.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\18. We live immersed in a racist society &amp;amp; racist discourse. So however anti-racist you are, you could still be harbouring racist attitudes &amp;amp; biases that you’re unaware of. Hence we need to examine our biases &amp;amp; question our assumptions. This is not guilt tripping, it’s awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\20. Intersectionality. Term coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw to describe intersecting oppressions. Originally used to describe the way Black women are oppressed both asBlack and as women and these oppressions intersect.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\21. Anti-racist social media etiquette. Don’t tag BIPOC people to call their attention to some obnoxious racist nonsense. They see enough of that without you dragging them into more of it. Tag @ nowhitenonsense instead. (White nonsense roundup)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\22. If you reply to a troll attacking a BIPOC person, just reply to the troll &amp;amp; not the BIPOC person; again this saves them a lot of aggro. Always report the troll to Twitter/FB. Although Twitter often says the troll is not violating the terms of service, it’s still worth doing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\23. A white supremacist society is one that’s organized for the benefit of white people. White supremacy as an ideology is the assumption that white people are better than everyone else. White supremacist societies don’t happen by accident, they’re driven by that ideology.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\24. Don’t assume that BIPOC want to talk about racism, land rights, etc (even if it’s an obsession for you because you just became aware).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\25. Don’t assume that any given BIPOC person is representative of their whole ethnic group, cultural group, or religion&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\26. Race is a social construct, but like gender, has real effects. Whiteness was invented/constructed in order to divide working class people. It assimilated various ethnic groups (Southern European, Eastern Europeans, and Jewish people were not originally seen as white.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\27. White fragility. When a white person has a meltdown because a racist thing (systemic or personal) is pointed out to them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\28. White tears. When a white person (usually a woman) bursts into tears when their Black friend describes systemic racism to them: not crying because of the injustice but because “oh you must hate me now”. (Ugh, was so horrified when I found out this was a thing.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\29. White tears, weaponised version: when a white woman cries about something a Black man has allegedly done to her, and bad stuff happens as a result. Really horrific stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\30. The unmarked default. A category of people that is regarded as the norm, therefore it doesn’t need a label — e.g. white, cisgender, heterosexual are all regarded as the unmarked default by some people in those categories and they have a hissy fit if they get labelled.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\31. Black names. Black people are recovering from centuries of oppression &amp;amp; if they choose unusual names that’s their right to assert their own culture in the face of continuing oppression.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\32. Indigenous names. Learn the proper name of Indigenous peoples and places (at least your local ones) rather than the English name. Examples: Mohawk = Kanienke:ha
Six Nations = Haudenosaunee
Lake Erie = Erielhonan&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\33. Names of other ethnic groups. Don’t say “what a weird name” when introduced to your PoC colleague or friend of a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\34. Don’t ask where someone’s from (or even worse, “where are you really from” — Accept the first answer they give). Wait to be told, or (if appropriate) ask where their accent is from, or what their heritage is. If in doubt, don’t ask.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\35. “Political correctness” was invented by the right as a stick to beat the left with. What anti-racists actually say is, let’s treat others respectfully. We never use the phrase “political correctness”. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dowsingfordivinity.wordpress.com/2016/08/20/5109/&quot;&gt;https://dowsingfordivinity.wordpress.com/2016/08/20/5109/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\36. If a BIPOC person relates something that happened to them, i.e. personal experience, don’t reply with statistics or generalizations or “well that’s never happened to me so it can’t be real”. If it happened, it happened. And if they regard it as racist, it was racist.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\37. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/UNDRIP?src=hash&quot;&gt;#UNDRIP&lt;/a&gt;. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. (2007) enshrines the right to self-determination and land title for Indigenous peoples.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\38. First Nations in Canada have control and use of 0.2% of the land. That’s a statistic from the government of Canada. (It doesn’t include Nunavut, afaik.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The standard of living in Canada is number 1 in the world. Standard of living for Indigenous peoples, 78th in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\39. Some Indigenous people (“status Indians”) are federally funded. This means they get much less funding per person than the rest of Canada, e.g. monthly welfare for Indigenous person, 2017: $138. Monthly welfare for unemployed Canadians, 2016: $733 (approximately).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\40. Just because you know one BIPOC person who doesn’t object to something that every other BIPOC person finds problematic (e.g. sports teams with dodgy names) doesn’t mean it isn’t a problem. If the majority of BIPOC people think something is objectionable or problematic, it is.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\41. “Mixed race”. There’s only one race, the human race. A person with parents of different colours is mixed heritage &amp;amp; their parents came from 2 different cultures, e.g. a person who is half Mikmaq and half Scottish has two cultures. (cf Métis — a merger of cultures, not genes)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;\42. (The answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything): DON’T BE A DICK.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you liked this thread, go read lots of anti-racist articles for more nuance than is possible in a tweet thread.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Martin Luther King, Jr's Letter From a Birmingham Jail</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On this Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, January 15, 2018, I think it’s
time to read the Letter from a Birmingham Jail in full, again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;letter-from-birmingham-jail&quot;&gt;LETTER FROM BIRMINGHAM JAIL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 16, 1963&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MY DEAR FELLOW CLERGYMEN:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While confined here in the Birmingham city jail, I came across your
recent statement calling my present activities “unwise and untimely.”
Seldom do I pause to answer criticism of my work and ideas. If I sought
to answer all the criticisms that cross my desk, my secretaries would
have little time for anything other than such correspondence in the
course of the day, and I would have no time for constructive work. But
since I feel that you are men of genuine good will and that your
criticisms are sincerely set forth, I want to try to answer your
statements in what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I should indicate why I am here In Birmingham, since you have
been influenced by the view which argues against “outsiders coming in.”
I have the honor of serving as president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, an organization operating in every southern
state, with headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. We have some eighty-five
affiliated organizations across the South, and one of them is the
Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. Frequently we share staff,
educational and financial resources with our affiliates. Several months
ago the affiliate here in Birmingham asked us to be on call to engage
in a nonviolent direct-action program if such were deemed necessary. We
readily consented, and when the hour came we lived up to our promise.
So I, along with several members of my staff, am here because I was
invited here I am here because I have organizational ties here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more basically, I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just
as the prophets of the eighth century B.C. left their villages and
carried their “thus saith the Lord” far beyond the boundaries of their
home towns, and just as the Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and
carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the
Greco-Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom
beyond my own home town. Like Paul, I must constantly respond to the
Macedonian call for aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and
states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what
happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice
everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied
in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects
all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow,
provincial “outside agitator” idea. Anyone who lives inside the United
States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham. But your
statement, I am sorry to say, fails to express a similar concern for
the conditions that brought about the demonstrations. I am sure that
none of you would want to rest content with the superficial kind of
social analysis that deals merely with effects and does not grapple
with underlying causes. It is unfortunate that demonstrations are
taking place in Birmingham, but it is even more unfortunate that the
city’s white power structure left the Negro community with no
alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps: collection of
the facts to determine whether injustices exist; negotiation;
self-purification; and direct action. We have gone through all of these
steps in Birmingham. There can be no gainsaying the fact that racial
injustice engulfs this community. Birmingham is probably the most
thoroughly segregated city in the United States. Its ugly record of
brutality is widely known. Negroes have experienced grossly unjust
treatment in the courts. There have been more unsolved bombings of
Negro homes and churches in Birmingham than in any other city in the
nation. These are the hard, brutal facts of the case. On the basis of
these conditions, Negro leaders sought to negotiate with the city
fathers. But the latter consistently refused to engage in good-faith
negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, last September, came the opportunity to talk with leaders of
Birmingham’s economic community. In the course of the negotiations,
certain promises were made by the merchants — for example, to remove
the stores humiliating racial signs. On the basis of these promises,
the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the Alabama
Christian Movement for Human Rights agreed to a moratorium on all
demonstrations. As the weeks and months went by, we realized that we
were the victims of a broken promise. A few signs, briefly removed,
returned; the others remained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in so many past experiences, our hopes had been blasted, and the
shadow of deep disappointment settled upon us. We had no alternative
except to prepare for direct action, whereby we would present our very
bodies as a means of laying our case before the conscience of the local
and the national community. Mindful of the difficulties involved, we
decided to undertake a process of self-purification. We began a series
of workshops on nonviolence, and we repeatedly asked ourselves : “Are
you able to accept blows without retaliating?” “Are you able to endure
the ordeal of jail?” We decided to schedule our direct-action program
for the Easter season, realizing that except for Christmas, this is the
main shopping period of the year. Knowing that a strong economic
withdrawal program would be the by-product of direct action, we felt
that this would be the best time to bring pressure to bear on the
merchants for the needed change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it occurred to us that Birmingham’s mayoralty election was coming
up in March, and we speedily decided to postpone action until after
election day. When we discovered that the Commissioner of Public
Safety, Eugene “Bull” Connor, had piled up enough votes to be in the
run-off we decided again to postpone action until the day after the
run-off so that the demonstrations could not be used to cloud the
issues. Like many others, we waited to see Mr. Connor defeated, and to
this end we endured postponement after postponement. Having aided in
this community need, we felt that our direct-action program could be
delayed no longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may well ask: “Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so
forth? Isn’t negotiation a better path?” You are quite right in
calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct
action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and
foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to
negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks to so dramatize the
issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of
tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather
shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word
“tension.” I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a
type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth.
Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the
mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and
half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective
appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create
the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark
depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding
and brotherhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of our direct-action program is to create a situation so
crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation. I
therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation. Too long has
our beloved Southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in
monologue rather than dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the basic points in your statement is that the action that I and
my associates have taken .in Birmingham is untimely. Some have asked:
“Why didn’t you give the new city administration time to act?” The only
answer that I can give to this query is that the new Birmingham
administration must be prodded about as much as the outgoing one,
before it will act. We are sadly mistaken if we feel that the election
of Albert Boutwell as mayor. will bring the millennium to Birmingham.
While Mr. Boutwell is a much more gentle person than Mr. Connor, they
are both segregationists, dedicated to maintenance of the status quo. I
have hope that Mr. Boutwell will be reasonable enough to see the
futility of massive resistance to desegregation. But he will not see
this without pressure from devotees of civil rights. My friends, I must
say to you that we have not made a single gain civil rights without
determined legal and nonviolent pressure. Lamentably, it is an
historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges
voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give
up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us,
groups tend to be more immoral than individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily
given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly,
I have yet to engage in a direct-action campaign that was “well timed”
in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of
segregation. For years now I have heard the word “Wait!” It rings in
the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This “Wait” has
almost always meant “Never.” We must come to see, with one of our
distinguished jurists, that “justice too long delayed is justice
denied.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and
God-given rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with
jetlike speed toward gaining political independence, but we stiff creep
at horse-and-buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch
counter. Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging
dark of segregation to say, “Wait.” But when you have seen vicious mobs
lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and
brothers at whim; when you have seen hate-filled policemen curse, kick
and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast
majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an
airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you
suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you
seek to explain to your six-year-old daughter why she can’t go to the
public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and
see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is
closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority
beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to
distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward
white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five-year-old
son who is asking: “Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so
mean?”; when you take a cross-country drive and find it necessary to
sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile
because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and
day out by nagging signs reading “white” and “colored”; when your first
name becomes “nigger,” your middle name becomes “boy” (however old you
are) and your last name becomes “John,” and your wife and mother are
never given the respected title “Mrs.”; when you are harried by day and
haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at
tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued
with inner fears and outer resentments; when you go forever fighting a
degenerating sense of “nobodiness” then you will understand why we find
it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs
over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of
despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and
unavoidable impatience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws.
This is certainly a legitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge
people to obey the Supreme Court’s decision of 1954 outlawing
segregation in the public schools, at first glance it may seem rather
paradoxical for us consciously to break laws. One may want to ask: “How
can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?” The answer
lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I
would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a
legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has
a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St.
Augustine that “an unjust law is no law at all”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what is the difference between the two? How does one determine
whether a law is just or unjust? A just law is a man-made code that
squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code
that is out of harmony with the moral law. To put it in the terms of
St. Thomas Aquinas: An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in
eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is
just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All
segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul
and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of
superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority.
Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin
Buber, substitutes an “I-it” relationship for an “I-thou” relationship
and ends up relegating persons to the status of things. Hence
segregation is not only politically, economically and sociologically
unsound, it is morally wrong and awful. Paul Tillich said that sin is
separation. Is not segregation an existential expression ‘of man’s
tragic separation, his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness?
Thus it is that I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme
Court, for it is morally right; and I can urge them to disobey
segregation ordinances, for they are morally wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us consider a more concrete example of just and unjust laws. An
unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority group compels a
minority group to obey but does not make binding on itself. This is
difference made legal. By the same token, a just law is a code that a
majority compels a minority to follow and that it is willing to follow
itself. This is sameness made legal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me give another explanation. A law is unjust if it is inflicted on
a minority that, as a result of being denied the right to vote, had no
part in enacting or devising the law. Who can say that the legislature
of Alabama which set up that state’s segregation laws was
democratically elected? Throughout Alabama all sorts of devious methods
are used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered voters, and there
are some counties in which, even though Negroes constitute a majority
of the population, not a single Negro is registered. Can any law
enacted under such circumstances be considered democratically
structured?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For
instance, I have been arrested on a charge of parading without a
permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in having an ordinance which
requires a permit for a parade. But such an ordinance becomes unjust
when it is used to maintain segregation and to deny citizens the First
Amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you are able to ace the distinction I am trying to point out. In
no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid
segregationist. That would lead to anarchy. One who breaks an unjust
law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the
penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience
tells him is unjust and who willingly accepts the penalty of
imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over
its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is nothing new about this kind of civil disobedience.
It was evidenced sublimely in the refusal of Shadrach, Meshach and
Abednego to obey the laws of Nebuchadnezzar, on the ground that a
higher moral law was at stake. It was practiced superbly by the early
Christians, who were willing to face hungry lions and the excruciating
pain of chopping blocks rather than submit to certain unjust laws of
the Roman Empire. To a degree, academic freedom is a reality today
because Socrates practiced civil disobedience. In our own nation, the
Boston Tea Party represented a massive act of civil disobedience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should never forget that everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was
“legal” and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary
was “illegal.” It was “illegal” to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler’s
Germany. Even so, I am sure that, had I lived in Germany at the time, I
would have aided and comforted my Jewish brothers. If today I lived in
a Communist country where certain principles dear to the Christian
faith are suppressed, I would openly advocate disobeying that country’s
antireligious laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish
brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have
been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost
reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling
block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler
or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to
“order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the
absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of
justice; who constantly says: “I agree with you in the goal you seek,
but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action”; who
paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man’s
freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly
advises the Negro to wait for a “more convenient season.” Shallow
understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than
absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance
is much more bewildering than outright rejection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order
exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fan in
this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the
flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would
understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase
of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro
passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive
peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human
personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are
not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden
tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it
can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long
as it is covered up but must be opened with an its ugliness to the
natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all
the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and
the air of national opinion before it can be cured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your statement you assert that our actions, even though peaceful,
must be condemned because they precipitate violence. But is this a
logical assertion? Isn’t this like condemning a robbed man because his
possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn’t this
like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and
his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by the misguided
populace in which they made him drink hemlock? Isn’t this like
condemning Jesus because his unique God-consciousness and never-ceasing
devotion to God’s will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We
must come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently
affirmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to
gain his basic constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate
violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject the myth
concerning time in relation to the struggle for freedom. I have just
received a letter from a white brother in Texas. He writes: “All
Christians know that the colored people will receive equal rights
eventually, but it is possible that you are in too great a religious
hurry. It has taken Christianity almost two thousand years to
accomplish what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to
earth.” Such an attitude stems from a tragic misconception of time,
from the strangely rational notion that there is something in the very
flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actually, time itself
is neutral; it can be used either destructively or constructively. More
and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more
effectively than have the people of good will. We will have to repent
in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the
bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people. Human
progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through
the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-workers with God, and
without this ‘hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of
social stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that
the time is always ripe to do right. Now is the time to make real the
promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a
creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national
policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of
human dignity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You speak of our activity in Birmingham as extreme. At fist I was
rather disappointed that fellow clergymen would see my nonviolent
efforts as those of an extremist. I began thinking about the fact that
stand in the middle of two opposing forces in the Negro community. One
is a force of complacency, made up in part of Negroes who, as a result
of long years of oppression, are so drained of self-respect and a sense
of “somebodiness” that they have adjusted to segregation; and in part
of a few middle class Negroes who, because of a degree of academic and
economic security and because in some ways they profit by segregation,
have become insensitive to the problems of the masses. The other force
is one of bitterness and hatred, and it comes perilously close to
advocating violence. It is expressed in the various black nationalist
groups that are springing up across the nation, the largest and
best-known being Elijah Muhammad’s Muslim movement. Nourished by the
Negro’s frustration over the continued existence of racial
discrimination, this movement is made up of people who have lost faith
in America, who have absolutely repudiated Christianity, and who have
concluded that the white man is an incorrigible “devil.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried to stand between these two forces, saying that we need
emulate neither the “do-nothingism” of the complacent nor the hatred
and despair of the black nationalist. For there is the more excellent
way of love and nonviolent protest. I am grateful to God that, through
the influence of the Negro church, the way of nonviolence became an
integral part of our struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this philosophy had not emerged, by now many streets of the South
would, I am convinced, be flowing with blood. And I am further
convinced that if our white brothers dismiss as “rabble-rousers” and
“outside agitators” those of us who employ nonviolent direct action,
and if they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts, millions of
Negroes will, out of frustration and despair, seek solace and security
in black-nationalist ideologies a development that would inevitably
lead to a frightening racial nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The yearning for
freedom eventually manifests itself, and that is what has happened to
the American Negro. Something within has reminded him of his birthright
of freedom, and something without has reminded him that it can be
gained. Consciously or unconsciously, he has been caught up by the
Zeitgeist, and with his black brothers of Africa and his brown and
yellow brothers of Asia, South America and the Caribbean, the United
States Negro is moving with a sense of great urgency toward the
promised land of racial justice. If one recognizes this vital urge that
has engulfed the Negro community, one should readily understand why
public demonstrations are taking place. The Negro has many pent-up
resentments and latent frustrations, and he must release them. So let
him march; let him make prayer pilgrimages to the city hall; let him go
on freedom rides–and try to understand why he must do so. If his
repressed emotions are not released in nonviolent ways, they will seek
expression through violence; this is not a threat but a fact of
history. So I have not said to my people: “Get rid of your discontent.”
Rather, I have tried to say that this normal and healthy discontent can
be channeled into the creative outlet of nonviolent direct action. And
now this approach is being termed extremist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But though I was initially disappointed at being categorized as an
extremist, as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained
a measure of satisfaction from the label. Was not Jesus an extremist
for love: “Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to
them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and
persecute you.” Was not Amos an extremist for justice: “Let justice
roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.”
Was not Paul an extremist for the Christian gospel: “I bear in my body
the marks of the Lord Jesus.” Was not Martin Luther an extremist: “Here
I stand; I cannot do otherwise, so help me God.” And John Bunyan: “I
will stay in jail to the end of my days before I make a butchery of my
conscience.” And Abraham Lincoln: “This nation cannot survive half
slave and half free.” And Thomas Jefferson: “We hold these truths to be
self-evident, that all men are created equal …” So the question is
not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will
be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremists
for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice? In
that dramatic scene on Calvary’s hill three men were crucified. We must
never forget that all three were crucified for the same crime—the
crime of extremism. Two were extremists for immorality, and thus fell
below their environment. The other, Jesus Christ, was an extremist for
love, truth and goodness, and thereby rose above his environment.
Perhaps the South, the nation and the world are in dire need of
creative extremists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had hoped that the white moderate would see this need. Perhaps I was
too optimistic; perhaps I expected too much. I suppose I should have
realized that few members of the oppressor race can understand the deep
groans and passionate yearnings of the oppressed race, and still fewer
have the vision to see that injustice must be rooted out by strong,
persistent and determined action. I am thankful, however, that some of
our white brothers in the South have grasped the meaning of this social
revolution and committed themselves to it. They are still too few in
quantity, but they are big in quality. Some—such as Ralph McGill,
Lillian Smith, Harry Golden, James McBride Dabbs, Ann Braden and Sarah
Patton Boyle—have written about our struggle in eloquent and
prophetic terms. Others have marched with us down nameless streets of
the South. They have languished in filthy, roach-infested jails,
suffering the abuse and brutality of policemen who view them as “dirty
nigger lovers.” Unlike so many of their moderate brothers and sisters,
they have recognized the urgency of the moment and sensed the need for
powerful “action” antidotes to combat the disease of segregation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me take note of my other major disappointment. I have been so
greatly disappointed with the white church and its leadership. Of
course, there are some notable exceptions. I am not unmindful of the
fact that each of you has taken some significant stands on this issue.
I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your Christian stand on this
past Sunday, in welcoming Negroes to your worship service on a non
segregated basis. I commend the Catholic leaders of this state for
integrating Spring Hill College several years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite these notable exceptions, I must honestly reiterate that I
have been disappointed with the church. I do not say this as one of
those negative .critics who can always find. something wrong with the
church. I say this as a minister of the gospel, who loves the church;
who was nurtured in its bosom; who has been sustained by its spiritual
blessings and who will remain true to it as long as the cord of Rio
shall lengthen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was suddenly catapulted into the leadership of the bus protest
in Montgomery, Alabama, a few years ago, I felt we would be supported
by the white church felt that the white ministers, priests and rabbis
of the South would be among our strongest allies. Instead, some have
been outright opponents, refusing to understand the freedom movement
and misrepresenting its leader era; an too many others have been more
cautious than courageous and have remained silent behind the
anesthetizing security of stained-glass windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of my shattered dreams, I came to Birmingham with the hope
that the white religious leadership of this community would see the
justice of our cause and, with deep moral concern, would serve as the
channel through which our just grievances could reach the power
structure. I had hoped that each of you would understand. But again I
have been disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard numerous southern religious leaders admonish their
worshipers to comply with a desegregation decision because it is the
law, but I have longed to hear white ministers declare: “Follow this
decree because integration is morally right and because the Negro is
your brother.” In the midst of blatant injustices inflicted upon the
Negro, I have watched white churchmen stand on the sideline and mouth
pious. irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities. In the midst of a
mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial and economic injustice, I
have heard many ministers say: “Those are social issues, with which the
gospel has no real concern.” And I have watched many churches commit
themselves to a completely other worldly religion which makes a
strange, on Biblical distinction between body and soul, between the
sacred and the secular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have traveled the length and breadth of Alabama, Mississippi and all
the other southern states. On sweltering summer days and crisp autumn
mornings I have looked at the South’s beautiful churches with their
lofty spires pointing heavenward. I have beheld the impressive outlines
of her massive religious-education buildings. Over and over I have
found myself asking: “What kind of people worship here? Who is their
God? Where were their voices when the lips of Governor Barnett dripped
with words of interposition and nullification? Where were they when
Governor Wallace gave a clarion call for defiance and hatred? Where
were their voices of support when bruised and weary Negro men and women
decided to rise from the dark dungeons of complacency to the bright
hills of creative protest?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, these questions are still in my mind. In deep disappointment I
have wept over the laxity of the church. But be assured that my tears
have been tears of love. There can be no deep disappointment where
there is not deep love. Yes, I love the church. How could I do
otherwise? l am in the rather unique position of being the son, the
grandson and the great-grandson of preachers. Yes, I see the church as
the body of Christ. But, oh! How we have blemished and scarred that
body through social neglect and through fear of being nonconformists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a time when the church was very powerful in the time when the
early Christians rejoiced at being deemed worthy to suffer for what
they believed. In those days the church was not merely a thermometer
that recorded the ideas and principles of popular opinion; it was a
thermostat that transformed the mores of society. Whenever the early
Christians entered a town, the people in power became disturbed and
immediately sought to convict the Christians for being “disturbers of
the peace” and “outside agitators”’ But the Christians pressed on, in
the conviction that they were “a colony of heaven,” called to obey God
rather than man. Small in number, they were big in commitment. They
were too God intoxicated to be “astronomically intimidated.” By their
effort and example they brought an end to such ancient evils as
infanticide. and gladiatorial contests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are different now. So often the contemporary church is a weak,
ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound. So often it is an
archdefender of the status quo. Par from being disturbed by the
presence of the church, the power structure of the average community is
consoled by the church’s silent and often even vocal sanction of things
as they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the judgment of God is upon the church as never before. If today’s
church does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of the early church,
it vi lose its authenticity, forfeit the loyalty of millions, and be
dismissed as an irrelevant social club with no meaning for the
twentieth century. Every day I meet young people whose disappointment
with the church has turned into outright disgust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I have once again been too optimistic. Is organized religion
too inextricably bound to the status quo to save our nation and the
world? Perhaps I must turn my faith to the inner spiritual church, the
church within the church, as the true ecclesia and the hope of the
world. But again I am thankful to God that some noble souls from the
ranks of organized religion have broken loose from the paralyzing
chains of conformity and joined us as active partners in the struggle
for freedom, They have left their secure congregations and walked the
streets of Albany, Georgia, with us. They have gone down the highways
of the South on tortuous rides for freedom. Yes, they have gone to jai
with us. Some have been dismissed from their churches, have lost the
support of their bishops and fellow ministers. But they have acted in
the faith that right defeated is stronger than evil triumphant. Their
witness has been the spiritual salt that has preserved the true meaning
of the gospel in these troubled times. They have carved a tunnel of
hope through the dark mountain of disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope the church as a whole will meet the challenge of this decisive
hour. But even if the church does not come to the aid of justice, I
have no despair about the future. I have no fear about the outcome of
our struggle in Birmingham, even if our motives are at present
misunderstood. We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham, ham and
all over the nation, because the goal of America k freedom. Abused and
scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up with America’s
destiny. Before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth, we were here. Before
the pen of Jefferson etched the majestic words of the Declaration of
Independence across the pages of history, we were here. For more than
two centuries our forebears labored in this country without wages; they
made cotton king; they built the homes of their masters while suffering
gross injustice and shameful humiliation-and yet out of a bottomless
vitality they continued to thrive and develop. If the inexpressible
cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the opposition we now face will
surely fail. We will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our
nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before closing I feel impelled to mention one other point in your
statement that has troubled me profoundly. You warmly commended the
Birmingham police force for keeping “order” and “preventing violence.”
I doubt that you would have so warmly commended the police force if you
had seen its dogs sinking their teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes.
I doubt that you would so quickly commend the policemen if you were to
observe their ugly and inhumane treatment of Negroes here in the city
jail; if you were to watch them push and curse old Negro women and
young Negro girls; if you were to see them slap and kick old Negro men
and young boys; if you were to observe them, as they did on two
occasions, refuse to give us food because we wanted to sing our grace
together. I cannot join you in your praise of the Birmingham police
department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that the police have exercised a degree of discipline in
handing the demonstrators. In this sense they have conducted themselves
rather “nonviolently” in public. But for what purpose? To preserve the
evil system of segregation. Over the past few years I have consistently
preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure
as the ends we seek. I have tried to make clear that it is wrong to use
immoral means to attain moral ends. But now I must affirm that it is
just as wrong, or perhaps even more so, to use moral means to preserve
immoral ends. Perhaps Mr. Connor and his policemen have been rather
nonviolent in public, as was Chief Pritchett in Albany, Georgia but
they have used the moral means of nonviolence to maintain the immoral
end of racial injustice. As T. S. Eliot has said: “The last temptation
is the greatest treason: To do the right deed for the wrong reason.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you had commended the Negro sit-inners and demonstrators of
Birmingham for their sublime courage, their willingness to suffer and
their amazing discipline in the midst of great provocation. One day the
South will recognize its real heroes. There will be the James
Merediths, with the noble sense of purpose that enables them to face
jeering and hostile mobs, and with the agonizing loneliness that
characterizes the life of the pioneer. There will be the old,
oppressed, battered Negro women, symbolized in a seventy-two-year-old
woman in Montgomery, Alabama, who rose up with a sense of dignity and
with her people decided not to ride segregated buses, and who responded
with ungrammatical profundity to one who inquired about her weariness:
“My feets is tired, but my soul is at rest.” There will be the young
high school and college students, the young ministers of the gospel and
a host of their elders, courageously and nonviolently sitting in at
lunch counters and willingly going to jail for conscience’ sake. One
day the South will know that when these disinherited children of God
sat down at lunch counters, they were in reality standing up for what
is best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in our
Judaeo-Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those
great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in
their formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of
Independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never before have I written so long a letter. I’m afraid it is much too
long to take your precious time. I can assure you that it would have
been much shorter if I had been writing from a comfortable desk, but
what else can one do when he is alone in a narrow jail cell, other than
write long letters, think long thoughts and pray long prayers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I have said anything in this letter that overstates the truth and
indicates an unreasonable impatience, I beg you to forgive me. If I
have said anything that understates the truth and indicates my having a
patience that allows me to settle for anything less than brotherhood, I
beg God to forgive me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. I also hope that
circumstances will soon make it possible for me to meet each of you,
not as an integrationist or a civil rights leader but as a fellow
clergyman and a Christian brother. Let us all hope that the dark clouds
of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of
misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear-drenched communities, and
in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and
brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their
scintillating beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours for the cause of Peace and Brotherhood,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*AUTHOR’S NOTE: This response to a published statement by eight fellow
clergymen from Alabama (Bishop C. C. J. Carpenter, Bishop Joseph A.
Durick, Rabbi Hilton L. Grafman, Bishop Paul Hardin, Bishop Holan B.
Harmon, the Reverend George M. Murray. the Reverend Edward V. Ramage
and the Reverend Earl Stallings) was composed under somewhat
constricting circumstance. Begun on the margins of the newspaper in
which the statement appeared while I was in jail, the letter was
continued on scraps of writing paper supplied by a friendly Negro
trusty, and concluded on a pad my attorneys were eventually permitted
to leave me. Although the text remains in substance unaltered, I have
indulged in the author’s prerogative of polishing it for publication.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Link: Amamzing Invisible Glass Rube Goldberg Machine (Laughing Squid)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://laughingsquid.com/&quot;&gt;Laughing Squid&lt;/a&gt; comes a report of an invention of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine&quot;&gt;Rube Goldberg-type machine&lt;/a&gt; with “invisible glass”. Coolest thing I’ve seen today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/C4i7qu7JFMk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://laughingsquid.com/invisible-glass-rube-goldberg-machine/&quot;&gt;https://laughingsquid.com/invisible-glass-rube-goldberg-machine/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Youtube Video: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/C4i7qu7JFMk&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/C4i7qu7JFMk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: (spoiler): they use an oil that has the same refractive properties as glass to make the glass inserted in the oil to “disapear” – since they are the same refractive index, light does not bend around the glass, so no edges become visible. Pretty cool!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Link: Thoughts on Leonard Peltier's 44th year of imprisonment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Link to article on Leonard Peltier, native american political prisoner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;h1 id=&quot;why-should-i-do-that-ive-already-given-them-one-life-for-this-why-should-i-give-them-two&quot;&gt;“Why should I do that? I’ve already given them one life for this. Why should I give them two?”&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Forty-four years ago today as I write this, Leonard Peltier was taken into custody. He remains a political prisoner at age 75. He was not sentenced to life without parole, yet that’s what he’s serving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, then President Obama granted clemency to nearly 50 federal prisoners serving sentences for drug-related crimes. Yet Leonard Peltier has never been convicted for the crimes he is accused of, having had no trial, instead he is being held in custody without trial or sentencing. In other words, &lt;strong&gt;he is a political prisoner&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/Leonard-Peltier.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Leonard Peltier, Native American Indian, Political Prisoner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;History may look on Leonard as a radical Native extremist who shot two law enforcement officers. But after speaking with those who knew him, I’ll always see Leonard as a genuinely nice guy, with a good sense of humor, who stood up for his people and protected them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Kelly told me today that when he was Leonard’s cellmate, he asked him why he didn’t snitch on the person who really did the shootings so he could get his sentence reduced. This is what Kelly told me Leonard said:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“He said, ‘Why should I do that? I’ve already given them one life for this. Why should I give them two?’”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Leonard is a warrior to the end. He accepts his destiny without protest. Even serving his time in silence is a form of resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>@salesses on twitter: white people, get free</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A poignant plea, from a father, to his mother on behalf of his child, and for all white people to become free of racism, fear, and colonialism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This country keeps white people so untrue to and unaware of themselves by tying their sense of inherent worth to their race. White people, get free.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Matthew Salesses (@salesses) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/salesses/status/1203464245402308608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 8, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unfurled-thread&quot;&gt;Unfurled thread:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My mom just cried and said she doesn’t know what to do anymore because I asked her to please this time read my daughter a book about a person of color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is ofc bec she isn’t ready to admit to herself her own racial bias, so every time she starts to feel it she has to reinterpret it as an attack in order to protect herself from her guilt. And it takes time &amp;amp; work, but either way the person who loses is my own kid. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tho if you can’t do this when you have raised three adopted kids of color and now have grandkids of color then what hope is there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This country keeps white people so untrue to and unaware of themselves by tying their sense of inherent worth to their race. White people, get free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dear white people, you are holding yourselves captive to your fear of being no better than an Asian man or Black woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You are holding yourselves captive to your fear of being as little in control and as much a subject of institutionalized hatred as the people you won’t admit you feel better than.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have been trying to save you your whole lives, but we can’t, and many of us have died and will die trying to save you whether we are willing to die for that or not, because you won’t save yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Good God&lt;br /&gt;
get free&lt;br /&gt;
get free&lt;br /&gt;
get free&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;#racism&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Erynn Brook on Twitter: Let your kids play</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A tweet that speaks volumes to me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As someone who has been teaching children, in some capacity, for 13 years, I beg of you. Please. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let them have unstructured play time.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Erynn Brook (@ErynnBrook) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ErynnBrook/status/1203348017367138311?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 7, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-tweet-chain-unfurled&quot;&gt;The tweet chain unfurled:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As someone who has been teaching children, in some capacity, for 13 years, I beg of you. Please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let them have unstructured play time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Please stop scheduling your children every moment of every day. Please stop encouraging them to schedule themselves. Please stop teaching them to view everything through a lens of educational value or productivity or usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When your high achieving young human comes to me for education in performing arts I spend so much time trying to unravel the absolute mess of expectations they have placed on themselves, because those expectations have been placed on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They are so stressed about getting it wrong or doing it badly or having it look or sound bad that it takes so long to teach them to relax, be themselves, take a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ve got 9 year olds with more muscle tension than most adults, just from holding the weight of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They’ve been taught that they’re being watched and evaluated at every turn and it’s nearly impossible for them to believe me when I say that they can’t do the work if they’re watching for my approval every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Recess isn’t enough. They need time to just be humans. Just let them be. Let them watch cartoons or read or draw or color or play or nap or sing or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Leave them alone. Don’t watch or care about what they’re making or doing. Just let them be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Don’t give feedback on how it could be better. Don’t tell them they sound great when they sing low but not when they sing high. Don’t tell them they’re better at drawing x than y. Don’t tell them anything. Just let them be and do and breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Buy them the stem toy. But also just some balls, some blocks, some crayons and notebooks with blank pages. Let them chop off their doll’s hair. Let them make up games and worlds and communicate and negotiate those worlds with their friends. Let them mess up and have fun doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I can’t teach them to be better artists if they’re too scared to make art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I can’t teach them to be better humans if they’re too scared of being human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You’re not teaching them to be better people. You’re teaching them to be better workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You’re crushing them. Stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While you’re at it, let yourself be. Just a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Do funny voices. Sing along to the music. Dance when you don’t know the moves. Draw something half as well as you think you could. Put down a yoga mat and make up your own style. Laugh with yourself, out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I could tell you all the scientific and pedagogical reasons why this is necessary, and it is necessary, but I’d rather you do it because you deserve to be you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You deserve to speak and write in your own voice. You deserve laughter. You deserve the entire human experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;P.S. I’m getting questions and I can’t really see them all because twitter doesn’t load everything right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ve gotten a few variations on “until what age should this be a thing?”. The answer is: until all ages. Forever. For you too, adults. For everyone. Play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>NYT: Jessica Slice: My wheelchair makes me a better mom</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Jessica Slice is a mom with Euler-Daniels Syndrome (EDS) which means she has limited ability to walk, stand and so on. It means she needs to use a wheelchair. It does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; mean she is “confined to a wheelchair”, an archaic, ablist, and destructive notion. She wrote an article for the New York Times about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://parenting.nytimes.com/parent-life/wheelchair-dysautonomia-ehlers-danlos-syndrome&quot;&gt;Link to NYT article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://parenting.nytimes.com/parent-life/wheelchair-dysautonomia-ehlers-danlos-syndrome&quot; title=&quot;NYTimes article 'My Power Wheelchair Makes Me a Better Mom' by Jessica Slice&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive bordered-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/images/nyt-jessica-slice-wchair-article.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of New York Times article by Jessica Slice showing masthead, article title, byline, and image of Ms Slice with her child in her lap&quot; title=&quot;NYTimes article 'My Power Wheelchair Makes Me a Better Mom' by Jessica Slice&quot; /&gt;

        <title>Link Collection</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s a dozen links of some stuff I’ve found interesting while perusing the web, twitter, fb, etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/opinion/colin-kaepernick-nfl.html&quot;&gt;Ta-Nehisi Coates: The Cancellation of Colin Kaepernick&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Cancel culture” has always existed — for the powerful, at least. Now, social media has democratized it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/xeni/status/1198586144704712706?s=20&quot;&gt;Tweet from @xeni on what to do with her tweets if you don’t like them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AwwwwCats/status/1198601119934623744&quot;&gt;a kitten confronts a peacock&lt;/a&gt; [critters]&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/becauseofthem/status/1198675150947962880?s=12&quot;&gt;daughter surprises her dad&lt;/a&gt; (Made me cry. I miss my kids so much.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/25/tim-berners-lee-launches-contract-for-the-web-to-fix-the-internet.html&quot;&gt;Sir Tim Berners-Lee is taking back his WWW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191031.html&quot;&gt;APOD: The Ghostly Veil Nebula&lt;/a&gt; This thing is &lt;em&gt;gorgeous&lt;/em&gt;!!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191125.html&quot;&gt;APOD: The Bat Nebula&lt;/a&gt; a part of the Veil Nebula, also gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://domainnamewire.com/2019/11/13/breaking-private-equity-company-acquires-org-registry/&quot;&gt;A private equity company has bought the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.org&lt;/code&gt; top level domain registry&lt;/a&gt; I’ll probably write more on this later, but OMG this sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DannyDutch/status/1196038086670585856&quot;&gt;An astounding murmuration of sandpipers that flashes black and white, sometimes disappearing against the sky&lt;/a&gt; [critters]&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Otter_News/status/1196155482332897282&quot;&gt;Cute otter paws&lt;/a&gt; [critters]&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191108.html&quot;&gt;NGC 3572 and the Southern Tadpoles&lt;/a&gt; I made a digital painting inspired by this: &lt;a href=&quot;https://tamouse.art/2019/11/random-procreate-painting/&quot;&gt;Random procreate painting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KyleKulinski/status/1193632667797016579&quot;&gt;Tweet with video of JFK arguing medicare for all&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

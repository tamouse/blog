<h1>Cassini Top 10 Science Highlights of 2014</h1>
Jan 27, 2015


</header>

<p>JPL’s Cassini Mission brings us a collection of highlights of the
science findings in 2014. Cassini keeps bringing us real wonders and
beauty, but also deep science and further understanding of our solar
system.</p>

  <p><a name="ocean"></a></p>

  <h2 id="1-ocean-detected-inside-enceladus">1. Ocean Detected Inside Enceladus</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>NASA’s Cassini spacecraft and Deep Space Network provided the first
geophysical measurements of the internal structure of Enceladus,
consistent with the existence of a hidden ocean inside the moon.</li>
    <li>Gravity measurements suggest a large, possibly regional, ocean about
6 miles (10 kilometers) deep, beneath an ice shell about 19 to 25 miles
(30 to 40 kilometers) thick.</li>
    <li>Flyby data yielded evidence of a zone inside the southern end of the
moon with higher density than other portions of the interior.</li>
    <li>Surface fractures, known as “tiger stripes,” may lead down to a part
of the moon that is tidally heated by the moon’s repeated flexing as
Enceladus follows its eccentric orbit around Saturn.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA18071"><img src="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/artwork/images/PIA18071-br500.jpg" alt="artist rendition of Enceladus" /></a></p>

  <p>This diagram illustrates the possible interior of Saturn’s moon
Enceladus based on a gravity investigation by Cassini and NASA’s Deep
Space Network, reported in April 2014.</p>

  <p><a name="geysers"></a></p>

  <h2 id="2-101-geysers-identified-on-enceladus">2. 101 Geysers Identified on Enceladus</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Scientists have identified 101 distinct geysers erupting on Saturn’s
icy moon Enceladus. Their analysis suggests that it is possible for
liquid water from the moon’s underground sea to reach all the way to its
surface.</li>
    <li>Each geyser erupts from one of the tiger stripe fractures and is
coincident with small hot spots.</li>
    <li>The greatest geyser activity coincides with the greatest thermal
radiation. Comparisons between the geysers and tidal stresses reveal
similar connections.</li>
    <li>Opening and closing of the fractures allow water vapor from below to
reach the surface.</li>
    <li>Condensation on the surface produces the hot spots.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/imagedetails/index.cfm?imageId=5061"><img src="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/moons/images/PIA17183-br500.jpg" alt="Enceladus" /></a></p>

  <p>This dramatic view looks across the region of Enceladus’ geyser basin
and down on the ends of the Baghdad and Damascus fractures that face
Saturn.</p>

  <p><a name="birth"></a></p>

  <h2 id="3-possible-birth-of-a-saturn-moon">3. Possible Birth of a Saturn Moon</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Cassini has documented the formation of a small icy object within the
rings of Saturn that may be a new moon, and may also provide clues to
the formation of the planet’s known moons.</li>
    <li>Disturbances at the very edge of Saturn’s A ring – the outermost of
the planet’s large, bright rings – are about 20 percent brighter than
their surroundings, measuring 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) long and 6
miles (10 kilometers) wide, the feature may be caused by the
gravitational effects of a nearby object.</li>
    <li>Not expected to grow any larger (and maybe even be falling apart) the
formation and outward movement of the object aids in our understanding
of how Saturn’s icy moons may have formed in more massive rings long
ago. It also provides insight into how Earth and other planets in our
solar system may have formed and migrated away from the sun.</li>
    <li>The object, informally named Peggy, is too small to be seen in images
so far, but is probably no more than about a half mile (about a
kilometer) in diameter.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/imagedetails/index.cfm?imageId=5008"><img src="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/rings/images/IMG005008-br500.jpg" alt="Saturn's rings" /></a></p>

  <p>The disturbance visible at the outer edge of Saturn’s A ring in this
image from Cassini could be caused by an object replaying the birth
process of icy moons.</p>

  <p><a name="seas"></a></p>

  <h2 id="4-sunny-seas-and-clouds-spotted-on-titan">4. Sunny Seas and Clouds Spotted on Titan</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Cassini has captured, for the first time, simultaneous views of both
the polar hydrocarbon seas and the sun glinting off one of the seas.</li>
    <li>A bright margin around Kraken Mare – the sea containing the
reflected sunglint – indicates that the sea was larger at some point,
but evaporation has decreased its size.</li>
    <li>Since a huge storm swept across the icy moon’s low latitudes in late
2010, only a few small clouds have been observed anywhere on the icy
moon. The lack of cloud activity has surprised researchers.</li>
    <li>Recent images of clouds moving across the northern hydrocarbon seas
of Saturn’s moon Titan have been obtained. This renewed weather
activity, considered overdue by researchers, could finally signal the
onset of summer storms that atmospheric models have long predicted.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a name="surface"></a></p>

  <h2 id="5-hyperions-electrostatically-charged-surface">5. Hyperion’s Electrostatically Charged Surface</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>During a 2005 flyby of Saturn’s moon Hyperion, the spacecraft was
briefly bathed in a beam of electrons coming from the moon’s
electrostatically charged surface.</li>
    <li>Static electricity is known to play an important role on our own
dusty moon, but evidence of static charge building up on other objects
in the solar system has been elusive until now.</li>
    <li>Hyperion is porous and icy, with a bizarre, sponge-like appearance.
Its surface is continuously bombarded by ultraviolet light from the sun
and exposed to a rain of electrons and ions within the invisible bubble
generated by Saturn’s magnetic field. Researchers think Hyperion’s
exposure to this hostile space environment is the source of the particle
beam that struck Cassini.</li>
    <li>Surface features observed on the asteroid Eros and several of
Saturn’s moons might be due to the motion of charged dust across their
surfaces.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/imagedetails/index.cfm?imageId=1762"><img src="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/moons/images/PIA07740-br500.jpg" alt="Hyperion" /></a></p>

details across the strange, tumbling moon’s surface.</p>

  <p><a name="island"></a></p>

  <h2 id="6-magic-island-evolves-in-titan-sea">6. ‘Magic Island’ Evolves in Titan Sea</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>A mysterious feature, dubbed the “Magic Island” has been monitored in
one of Titan’s large hydrocarbon seas. The feature covers an area of
about 100 square miles (260 square kilometers) in Ligeia Mare.</li>
    <li>The feature, which appears bright in radar images against the dark
background of the liquid sea, was first spotted during Cassini’s July
2013 Titan flyby. It has now been observed twice by Cassini’s radar
experiment, but its appearance changed between the two apparitions.</li>
    <li>The feature could be surface waves, rising bubbles, floating solids,
solids suspended just below the surface, or perhaps something more
exotic.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/imagedetails/index.cfm?imageId=5098"><img src="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/moons/images/IMG005098-br500.jpg" alt="Titan's Ligeia Mare" /></a></p>

  <p>These three images, created from Cassini Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
data, show the appearance and evolution of a mysterious feature in
Ligeia Mare, one of the largest hydrocarbon seas on Saturn’s moon Titan.</p>

  <p><a name="frozen"></a></p>

  <h2 id="7-mimas-hides-frozen-core-or-ocean">7. Mimas Hides Frozen Core or Ocean</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Even though Mimas’ heavily cratered outward appearance does not
suggest anything unusual lies beneath its surface, its interior either
has a frozen core shaped something like a football or the satellite
contains a liquid water ocean.</li>
    <li>Observations of how much the moon wobbles as it orbits Saturn
constrain models for how its interior might be arranged leading to two
possibilities that fit the data.</li>
    <li>If Mimas is hiding a liquid water ocean, it lies 15 to 20 miles (24
to 31 kilometers) beneath the moon’s impact-battered surface. At 246
miles (396 kilometers) wide, Mimas is too small to have retained
internal heat from its formation, so some other source of energy would
be required to maintain an underground ocean.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/imagedetails/index.cfm?imageId=3913"><img src="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/moons/images/PIA12569-br500.jpg" alt="Mimas" /></a></p>

  <p>This mosaic of Saturn’s moon Mimas was created from images taken by
Cassini during its closest flyby of the moon (Feb. 13, 2010).</p>

  </ul>

  <hr />

  <p><a name="clumps"></a></p>

  <h2 id="8-bright-clumps-diminish-in-the-f-ring">8. Bright Clumps Diminish in the F Ring</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The number of exceptionally bright clumps of material in the F ring
plummeted during the time between NASA’s Voyager mission and Cassini’s
mission, a period of 30 years.</li>
    <li>The diminishing number of bright clumps could be the result of a drop
in the number of little moonlets between the Voyager and Cassini eras.</li>
    <li>Saturn’s moon Prometheus is the prime suspect for this behavior.
Prometheus orbits just inside the F ring and stirs up the ring
particles, sometimes leading to the creation of moonlets, and sometimes
leading to their destruction.</li>
    <li>Every 17 years, the orbit of Prometheus aligns with the orbit of the
F ring in such a way that its influence is particularly strong spurring
the creation of many new moonlets. The moonlets would then crash
repeatedly through the F ring, eventually destroying them.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/imagedetails/index.cfm?imageId=4990"><img src="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/rings/images/PIA17154-br500.jpg" alt="Spokes on Saturn's rings" /></a></p>

  <p>This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings; the image
was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera
on Oct. 22, 2013.</p>

  </ul>

  <hr />

  <p><a name="salty"></a></p>

  <h2 id="9-titans-salty-sea">9. Titan’s Salty Sea</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Cassini gravity data has provided firm evidence that the ocean inside
Titan might be as salty as Earth’s Dead Sea.</li>
    <li>Findings support previous indications that the moon’s icy shell is
rigid and in the process of freezing solid. The thickness of the ice
crust varies slightly from place to place, consistent with the ocean
slowly crystalizing and turning to ice.</li>
    <li>The ocean is probably an extremely salty brine of water mixed with
dissolved salts likely composed of sulfur, sodium and potassium. The
density indicated for this brine would give the ocean a salt content
roughly equal to the saltiest bodies of water on Earth.</li>
    <li>Outgassing of methane into Titan’s atmosphere must happen at
scattered “hot spots” as opposed to via convection or plate tectonics
recycling of its ice shell.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><img src="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/files/Titan_OceanandIce_Main_1200w.jpg" alt="Artist rendition of Titan" /></p>

  <p>Researchers found that Titan’s ice shell, which overlies a very salty
ocean, varies in thickness around the moon, suggesting the crust is in
the process of becoming rigid.</p>

  </ul>

  <hr />

  <p><a name="auroras"></a></p>

  <h2 id="10-new-views-of-saturns-auroras">10. New Views of Saturn’s Auroras</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Observations from multiple vantage points (e.g. Cassini orbiting
Saturn and Hubble orbiting Earth) provided details on how the auroras
move, showing the complexity of these auroras and how they connect to
outbursts from the sun and their effect on Saturn’s magnetic
environment.</li>
    <li>One way that bright auroral storms may be produced is by the
formation of new connections between magnetic field lines causing storms
within Saturn’s magnetic bubble.</li>
    <li>Mimas and Enceladus can influence Saturn’s light show as well.</li>
    <li>Curtain-like auroras at Saturn, similar to those seen on Earth, are
red at the bottom and purple at the top because they are dominated by
emission from excited hydrogen molecules.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><img src="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/files/potw1420a_full.jpg" alt="Saturn's Aurorae" /></p>

  <p>Astronomers using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope have captured new
images of the dancing auroral lights at Saturn’s north pole.</p>

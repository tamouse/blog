  <p>To kick off the new school year, we have 10 ways to make practicing more
effective and a happier experience.</p>

  <p>Last summer, we published a week-long series called <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/155272002/the-young-persons-guide-to-making-music">“The Young Person’s Guide to Making Music”</a>
in collaboration with our colleagues at the radio program <a href="http://www.fromthetop.org/"><em>From The Top</em>.</a> The idea was to provide guidance and
suggestions for parents and kids just starting out in music, with ideas
for everything from finding a great teacher to reducing audition
anxiety.</p>

  <p>The piece in that series that struck the biggest chord (har, har) was
titled <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2012/06/18/155282684/getting-kids-to-practice-music-without-tears-or-tantrums">“Getting Kids to Practice Music — Without Tears Or Tantrums”</a>;
it’s been one of our most popular posts all year. And we promised
ourselves that we’d circle back to the topic of how to practice
effectively around the time of a new school year. But these tips are
effective for anyone who plays an instrument or sings.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Find somewhere quiet.</strong> This seems too obvious for words, but not
only will you be far less likely to succumb to all sorts of
distractions, but entering a special practice area, whether it’s a
certain room or just a corner of the living room, will help prepare
you mentally for this very particular kind of work. Mindful
intention is everything, and having the ritual of going to the same
place every time can help set that intention.</li>
    <li><strong>Have your supplies nearby.</strong> I really love cellist David Finckel’s
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAE1ED06AB33DF65D">“Cello Talks”</a>
100-video series on YouTube; you don’t have to play cello to get a
lot out of many of them. Some of what he covers seems like
impossibly basic advice — as in the discussion (below) of his
practice space. Part of his advice is to keep a pencil sharpener and
a very clean eraser within arm’s reach, along with a pencil to mark
up your music. Simple, right? But those little things are easy to
forget, and if you have to go searching for them, add up to a big
waste of time.</li>
    <li><strong>Technology can be an amazing aid</strong> — as long as you don’t spend
too much time futzing with it. Three free or low-cost apps I have on
my phone and iPad: a metronome, a tuner and a timer, which are all
essential tools for practicing. And I always have my phone with me
(see above).</li>
    <li><strong>Begin with the end in mind: Have a goal for each practice session
before you start playing.</strong> Just playing through your music isn’t the
same thing as practicing. Before you start, think: What do I want
to accomplish today? If you’re not sure what you need to focus on,
ask your teacher for a few concrete goals to work toward before the
next lesson — and write them down so that you can refer to them
during your practice sessions.</li>
    <li><strong>Map a practice session out like a workout.</strong> Lots of musicians
start with a few actual stretches and breathing exercises before
they pick up their instruments. Even if you don’t go quite that far,
a pretty common scenario is to start with scales as a warm-up, to
loosen up your muscles and get your brain thinking about technique;
move on to the “working” part where you analyze and try to solve
problems; then cool down by improvising or revisiting some music you
already know well.</li>
    <li><strong>Practice smarter, not necessarily longer.</strong> You’ll probably
accomplish a whole lot more in a short amount of time if you have a
very focused objective — and science tells us that we have a
<a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/09/18/140516974/resistance-training-for-your-willpower-muscles">limited amount of willpower</a>
to draw upon anyway. So make the most of the time you have. Say you
are having trouble with two very tricky measures. Set your timer for
a short period (like five or 10 minutes), and then work just on one
problem in as many ways as you can — break it down into even smaller
and more manageable bits, go super slow, try to play the passage
backwards, change the rhythm, whatever. If that trouble spot is
still giving you <em>agita</em>, then make yourself a mental note to come
back to that section again tomorrow. Chances are it will be much,
much easier the next time around.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t always start at the beginning every time.</strong> Remember what I
said about maximizing your time and your willpower? This. It can
feel really good to hear yourself playing the beginning of a piece
beautifully, but you may wind up wasting the limited time and energy
you have. (Also, it leads to performances that start strong and
then, well, wilt.)</li>
    <li><strong>Challenge yourself — physically.</strong> Especially if you’re trying to
wrestle down an element that you find problematic, scientific
researchers say that if you add a physical challenge to the
difficult task, such as trying to play that part while standing on
one leg or while walking, your brain is likely to start carving out
new neural pathways — and the original task will be easier when you
return to just doing that.</li>
    <li><strong>Practice away from your instrument.</strong>Many musicians use
visualization in the same way that athletes do: They run through
their music without touching their instruments. Try bringing your
music along with you (either on paper or a mobile device) when you
know you’ll have some downtime, such as during a car or train ride,
and read through the piece silently.</li>
    <li><strong>Reward hard work — in positive ways — to help your brain automate
good habits.</strong> That sounds like out-and-out bribery, but again,
science! Finding something that your brain likes helps it remember
the “<a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/03/05/147192599/habits-how-they-form-and-how-to-break-them">habit loop</a>,”
writes Charles Duhigg, author of <em>The Power of Habit</em>.</li>

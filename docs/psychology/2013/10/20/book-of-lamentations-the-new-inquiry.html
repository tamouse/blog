<h1>Book of Lamentations – The New Inquiry</h1>
Oct 20, 2013


</header>

<p>“Best review of the DSM, EVAR!!! A great way of deconstructing the
manual used by psychiatrists and psychologists to pathologize every
form of human behaviour imaginable.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1 id="book-of-lamentations">Book of Lamentations</h1>

  <p>By <em><a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/author/skriss/" title="Posts by Sam Kriss">Sam Kriss</a></em></p>

  <p><strong><em>A new dystopian novel in the classic mode takes the form of a
dictionary of madness</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  <p>The best dystopian literature, or at least the most effective,
manages to show us a hideous and contorted future while resisting
the temptation to point fingers and invent villains. This is one of
the major flaws in George Orwells’s <em>1984</em>: When O’Brien laughingly
expounds on his vision of “a boot stamping on a human face –
forever” he starts to acquire the ludicrousness of a Bond villain;
he may as well be a cartoon – one of the Krusty Kamp counsellors in
<em>The Simpsons</em>, raising a glass “to Evil.” Orwell’s satire of
Stalinism, or Margaret Atwood’s on the religious right in <em>The
Handmaid’s Tale</em>tend to let our present world off the hook a little
by comparison. More subtle works, like Huxley’s <em>Brave New World</em>,
are far more effective. His Controller, when interrogated, doesn’t
burst out in maniacal laughter and start twiddling his moustache. He
explains, in quite reasonable terms, why the dystopia he lives in is
the best way to ensure the happiness of all – and he means
it. Everything’s broken, but it’s not anyone’s fault; it’s
terrifying because it’s so familiar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/dsm-5-cover.png"><img src="http://thenewinquiry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/dsm-5-cover-174x241.png" alt="" title="dsm-5-cover" /></a>American
Psychiatric Association <em>DSM-5</em> American Psychiatric Publishing (991
pages)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Great dystopia isn’t so much fantasy as a kind of estrangement or
 dislocation from the present; the ability to stand outside time and
 see the situation in its full hideousness. The dystopian novel
 doesn’t necessarily have to be a novel. Maybe the greatest piece of
 dystopian literature ever written is Theodor Adorno’s <em>Minima
 Moralia</em>, a collection of observations and aphorisms penned by the
 philosopher while in exile in America during and after the Second
 World War. Even if, like I do, you disagree enthusiastically with his
 blanket condemnation of all “degenerated” popular culture, it’s hard
 not to be convinced that what we are living is “damaged life.” It’s
 not an argument so much as revelation. In Adorno’s bitterly lucid
 critique everything we take for “The libidinal achievements demanded
 of an individual behaving as healthy in body and mind are such as can
 be performed only at the cost of the profoundest mutilation … the
 regular guy, the popular girl, have to repress not only their desires
 and insights, but even the symptoms that in bourgeois times resulted
 from repression.” – <em>Minima Moralia</em>granted is suddenly revealed in
 all its hideousness. The world Adorno lives in isn’t quite the same
 as ours; he’s coming at his subjects from a reflex angle – they’re a
 bunch of average Joes and Janes, he’s a misanthropic German cultural
 theorist with a preternaturally spherical head – but his insights are
 all the more relevant because of this. Something has gone terribly
 wrong in the world; we are living the wrong life, a life without any
 real fulfillment. The newly published <em>DSM-5</em> is a classic dsytopian
 novel in this mold.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s also not exactly a conventional novel. Its full title is an
  unwieldy mouthful: <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
  Disorders, Fifth Edition</em>. The author (or authors) writes under the
  ungainly <em>nom de plume</em> of The American Psychiatric Association –
  although a list of enjoyably silly pseudonyms is provided inside
  (including Maritza Rubio-Stipec, Dan Blazer, and the superbly
  alliterative Susan Swedo). The thing itself is on the cumbersome
  side. Over two inches thick and with a thousand pages, it’s unlikely
  to find its way to many beaches. Not that this should deter anyone;
  within is a brilliantly realized satire, at turns luridly absurd,
  chillingly perceptive, and profoundly disturbing.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the novel has an overbearing literary influence, it’s undoubtedly
  Jorge Luis Borges. The American Psychiatric Association takes his
  technique of lifting quotes from or writing faux-serious reviews for
  entirely imagined books and pushes it to the limit: Here, we have an
  entire book, something that purports to be a kind of encyclopedia of
  madness, a Library of Babel for the mind, containing everything that
  can possibly be wrong with a human being. Perhaps as an attempt to
  ward off the uncommitted reader, the novel begins with a lengthy
  account of the system of classifications used – one with an obvious
  debt to the Borgesian <em>Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge</em>,
  in which animals are exhaustively classified according to such sets
  as “those belonging to the Emperor,” “those that, at a distance,
  resemble flies,” and “those that are included in this
  classification.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just as Borges’s system groups animals by seemingly aleatory
  characteristics entirely divorced from their actual biological
  attributes, <em>DSM-5</em> arranges its various strains of madness solely
  in terms of the behaviors exhibited. This is a recurring theme in
  the novel, while any consideration of the mind itself is entirely
  absent. In its place we’re given diagnoses such as “frotteurism,”
  “oppositional defiant disorder,” and “caffeine intoxication
  disorder.” That said, these classifications aren’t arranged at
  random; rather, they follow a stately progression comparable to that
  of Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>, rising from the infernal pit of the body
  and its weaknesses (intellectual disabilities, motor tics) through
  our purgatorial interactions with the outside world (tobacco use,
  erectile dysfunction, kleptomania) and finally arriving in the
  limpid-blue heavens of our libidinal selves (delirium, personality
  disorders, sexual fetishism). It’s unusual, and at times frustrating
  in its postmodern knowingness, but what is being told is first and
  foremost a story.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a story without any of the elements that are traditionally
  held to constitute a setting or a plot. A few characters make an
  appearance, but they are nameless, spectral shapes, ones that wander
  in and out of view as the story progresses, briefly embodying their
  various illnesses before vanishing as quickly as they came – figures
  comparable to the cacophony of voices in <em>The Waste Land</em> or the
  anonymously universal figures of Jose Saramago’s <em>Blindness</em>. A
  sufferer of major depression and of hyperchondriasis might
  eventually be revealed to be the same person, but for the most part
  the boundaries between diagnoses keep the characters apart from one
  another, and there are only flashes. On one page we meet a hoarder,
  on the next a trichotillomaniac; he builds enormous “stacks of
  worthless objects,” she idly pulls out her pubic hairs while
  watching television. But the two are never allowed to meet and see
  if they can work through their problems together.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is not to say that there is no setting, no plot, and no
  characterization. These elements are woven into the
  encyclopedia-form with extraordinary subtlety. The setting of the
  novel isn’t a physical landscape but a conceptual one. Unusually for
  what purports to be a dictionary of madness, the story proper begins
  with a discussion of neurological impairments: autism, Rett’s
  disorder, “intellectual disability”. The scene this prologue sets is
  one of a profoundly bleak view of human beings; one in which we
  hobble across an empty field, crippled by blind and mechanical
  forces whose workings are entirely beyond any understanding. This
  vision of humanity’s predicament has echoes of Samuel Beckett at
  some of his more nihilistic moments – except that Beckett allows his
  tramps to speak for themselves, and when they do they’re often quite
  cheerful. The sufferers of <em>DSM-5</em>, meanwhile, have no voice;
  they’re only interrogated by a pitiless system of categorizations
  with no ability to speak back. As you read, you slowly grow aware
  that the book’s real object of fascination isn’t the various
  sicknesses described in its pages, but the sickness inherent in
  their arrangement.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Who, after all, would want to compile an exhaustive list of mental
  illnesses? The opening passages of <em>DSM-5</em> give us a long history of
  the purported previous editions of the book and the endless
  revisions and fine-tunings that have gone into the work. This mad
  project is clearly something that its authors are fixated on to a
  somewhat unreasonable extent. In a retrospectively predictable
  ironic twist, this precise tendency is outlined in the book
  itself. The entry for obsessive-compulsive disorder with poor
  insight describes this taxonomical obsession in deadpan tones:
  “repetitive behavior, the goal of which is […] to prevent some
  dreaded event or situation.” Our narrator seems to believe that by
  compiling an exhaustive list of everything that might go askew in
  the human mind, this wrong state might somehow be overcome or
  averted. References to compulsive behavior throughout the book
  repeatedly refer to the “fear of dirt in someone with an obsession
  about contamination.” The tragic clincher comes when we’re told,
  “the individual does not recognize that the obsessions or
  compulsions are excessive or unreasonable.” This mad project is so
  overwhelming that its originator can’t even tell that they’ve
  subsumed themselves within its matrix. We’re dealing with a truly
  unreliable narrator here, not one that misleads us about the course
  of events (the narrator <em>is</em> compulsive, they <em>do</em> have poor
  insight), but one whose entire conceptual framework is radically
  off-kilter. As such, the entire story is a portrait of the
  narrator’s own particular madness. With this realization, <em>DSM-5</em>
  starts to enter the realm of the properly dystopian.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This madness does lead to some startling moments of humor. One
  vignette describes in deadpan tones a scene at once touchingly
  pathos-laden and more than a little creepy: “He rubs his genitals
  against the victim’s thighs and buttocks. While doing this he
  fantasizes an exclusive, caring relationship with the victim.” The
  entry on caffeine intoxication disorder informs us, with every
  appearance of seriousness, that the diagnostic criteria include
  “recent consumption of caffeine” along with “1) restlessness 2)
  nervousness 3) excitement.” There are, occasionally, what seem to be
  surreal parodies of religious dietary regulations: “Infants and
  younger children […] eat paint, plaster, string, hair, or
  cloth. Older children may eat animal droppings, sand, insects,
  leaves, or pebbles.” What the levity of these moments masks, though,
  is the sense of loneliness that saturates the work.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The narrative voice of the book affects a tone of clinical
  detachment, one in which drinking coffee and paranoid-type
  schizophrenia can be discussed with the same flat tone. Under the
  pretense of dispassion this voice embodies a whole raft of
  terrifying preconceptions. Just like the neurological disorders that
  appear at the start of the book, mental illnesses appear like
  lightning bolts, with all their aura of divine randomness. Even when
  etiologies are mentioned they’re invariably held to be either
  genetic or refer to other illnesses such as substance abuse
  disorders. At no point is there any sense that madness might be
  socially informed, that the forms it takes might be a reflection of
  the influences and pressures of the world that surrounds us.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The idea emerges that every person’s illness is somehow their own
  fault, that it comes from nowhere but themselves: their genes, their
  addictions, and their inherent human insufficiency. We enter a
  strange shadow-world where for someone to engage in prostitution
  isn’t the result of intersecting environmental factors (gender
  relations, economic class, family and social relationships) but a
  symptom of “conduct disorder,” along with “lying, truancy, [and]
  running away.” A mad person is like a faulty machine. The
  pseudo-objective gaze only sees what they do, rather than what they
  think or how they feel. A person who shits on the kitchen floor
  because it gives them erotic pleasure and a person who shits on the
  kitchen floor to ward off the demons living in the cupboard are both
  shunted into the diagnostic category of encopresis. It’s not just
  that their thought-process don’t matter, it’s as if they don’t
  exist. The human being is a web of flesh spun over a void.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>With this radical misreading, the American Psychiatric Association
  is following something of a precedent in the actual psychological
  professions. Sigmund Freud himself performs a similar feat of
  <em>ostranenie</em> in his <em>Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality</em>, in
  which he appears to take the position of an alien observer of
  everyday affairs, noting that “the kiss […] is held in high sexual
  esteem among many nations in spite of the fact that the parts of the
  body involved do not form part of the sexual apparatus but
  constitute the entrance to the digestive tract.” If you’re going to
  make a properly objective study of human behavior, to some extent
  you have to disavow your own humanity. You have to ask, <em>why</em>
  kissing? Why <em>do</em> people press their mouths up against each other?
  In <em>DSM-5</em> we can see a perverse mirror image of this kind of
  estrangement. Freud retreats to a position of inhuman detachment to
  ask questions. Here, the narrator does it to issue instructions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The word “disorder” occurs so many times that it almost detaches
  itself from any real signification, so that the implied existence of
  an ordered state against which a disorder can be measured nearly
  vanishes is almost forgotten. Throughout the novel, this ordered
  normality never appears except as an inference; it is the object of
  a subdued, hopeless yearning. With normality as a negatively defined
  and nebulously perfect ideal, anything and everything can then be
  condemned as a deviation from it. Even an outburst of happiness can
  be We’re told this consists of a prolonged period during which the
  sufferer’s mood “may be described as euphoric, unusually good,
  cheerful, or high” and in which “the person may spontaneously start
  extensive conversations with strangers in public places,” or – more
  distressingly, admittedly – “a salesperson may telephone strangers
  at home in the early morning hours to initiate sales”diagnosed as a
  manic episode. And then there are the “not otherwise specified”
  personality disorder categories. Here all pretensions to objectivity
  fall apart and the novel’s carefully warped imitation of scientific
  categories fades into an examination of petty viciousness. A
  personality disorder not otherwise specified is the diagnosis for
  anyone whose behaviors “do not meet the full criteria for any one
  Personality Disorder, but that together cause clinically significant
  distress […] eg. social or occupational.” It’s hard not to be
  reminded of a few people who’ve historically caused social or
  occupational distress. If you don’t believe that people really
  exist, any radical call for their emancipation is just sickness at
  its most annoying.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If there is a normality here, it’s a state of
  near-catatonia. <em>DSM-5</em> seems to have no definition of happiness
  other than the absence of suffering. The normal individual in this
  book is tranquilized and bovine-eyed, mutely accepting everything in
  a sometimes painful world without ever feeling much in the way of
  anything about it. The vast absurd excesses of passion that form the
  raw matter of art, literature, love, and humanity are too
  distressing; it’s easier to stop being human altogether, to simply
  plod on as a heaped collection of diagnoses with a body vaguely
  attached.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>For all the subtlety of its characterization, the book doesn’t just
  provide a chilling psychological portrait, it conjures up an entire
  world. The clue is in the name: On some level we’re to imagine that
  the American Psychiatric Association is a body with real powers,
  that the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual” is something that might
  actually be used, and that its caricature of our inner lives could
  have serious consequences. Sections like those on the personality
  disorders offer a terrifying glimpse of a futuristic system of
  repression, one in which deviance isn’t furiously stamped out like
  it is in Orwell’s unsubtle Oceania, but pathologized instead. Here
  there’s no need for any rats, and the diagnostician can honestly
  believe she’s doing the right thing; it’s all in the name of
  restoring the sick to health. <em>DSM-5</em> describes a nightmare society
  in which human beings are individuated, sick, and alone. For much of
  the novel, what the narrator of this story is describing is its own
  solitude, its own inability to appreciate other people, and its own
  overpowering desire for death – but the real horror lies in the
  world that could produce such a voice.</p>

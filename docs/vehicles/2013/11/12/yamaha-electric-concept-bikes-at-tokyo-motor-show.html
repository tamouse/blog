<h1>Yamaha Electric Concept Bikes at Tokyo Motor Show</h1>
Nov 12, 2013


</header>

<p>Yamaha has put up a set of concept bikes for the Tokyo Motor
Show. I’ve been interested in electric motorcycles for a while now,
years, even. I had an electric scooter at one point, but it was a very
underpowered thing that I didn’t really consider safe enough for heavy
traffic areas.</p>

<p>But here, Yamaha is making a different sort of thing. These are true
commuter bikes, not just little electric mopeds.</p>

<p>The PES1, below, looks pretty nice:</p>

<p>Wired writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yamaha is going all-out at this year’s Tokyo Motor Show, bringing a
handful of concepts that point the way forward, along with one
firmly rooted in the past, just to balance things out.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The headliner is the PES1 above. It’s Yamaha’s latest electric bike
concept, and at an unbelievably lightweight 220 pounds, it’s the
electric motorcycle we’ve been waiting for. The battery pack is
mounted in the middle and acts as a stressed member of the chassis,
with the headstock and swing arm integrated into the exceptionally
lithe frame. A brushless DC motor is fixed low in the body, with the
rear shock below. The transmission is a fully automated box, with
the ability to go from manual to automatic control with the flick of
a switch. Despite the lack of indicators, mirrors, and a license
plate holder, the PES1 looks remarkably production ready, although
that gaping hole in the “tank” would be better used to pack a few
extra kWh of battery cells, and we have no idea how Yamaha could
keep the curb weight so low without severely limiting the range.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yamaha’s presser on the Motor show gives a rather breathless
description, without actually providing much info:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition to the characteristics unique to an electric motor, the
<strong>P</strong>assion within the new riding experience these two <strong>E</strong>V
(electric vehicle) motorcycle concept models offer is clear-cut, and
they retain the same operational feeling that current motorcycle
riders are used to. The <strong>S</strong>treet sport “PES1” and <strong>D</strong>irt sport
“PED1” have a power unit (Yamaha Smart Power Module) with a
monocoque structure that also functions as the frame. Supplementing
the environmental performance inherent to an EV, both models are
equipped with features like a transmission with manual and automatic
modes, a removable battery for easy replacement and various types of
smartphone information service functions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All the bikes shown at TMS from Yamaho look pretty cool.</p>

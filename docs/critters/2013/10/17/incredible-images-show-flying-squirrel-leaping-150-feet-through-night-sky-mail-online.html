<p>Those little critters really <em>can</em> fly!!</p>

  <p>It might look nuts but this tiny squirrel thinks nothing of making
incredible 150-foot leaps through the trees.  As these amazing
pictures show the southern flying squirrel becomes more bird than
mammal as it stretches out its body into a natural glider.  Despite
being nocturnal, the cute critter was caught on camera by British
photographer Kim Taylor making its nighttime jumps.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mr Taylor used a clever combination of a 150mm camera lens and a
special 3,500 volt high-speed flash triggered by an infra red beam
to capture the images.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Southern flying squirrels are lightweight at just 65g feed mostly on
insects, nuts and acorns. ‘These animals are strictly nocturnal and
live in tree holes, such as disused woodpecker holes,’ said Mr
Taylor, 79, who runs his own studio called Warren Photographic, in
Guildford, England. ‘They feed mainly on nuts and acorns and glide
from tree to tree on stretched skin flaps, each time losing height
while gliding and gaining height by climbing the next tree.’</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The animal in the photos was kept in a large flight arena, provided
with a high nest box in which it lived. At dusk it emerged from its
nest and glided down to one of several tree trunks placed in the
arena, and then climbed upwards to reach a feeding platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>An infra red beam was placed across the likely flight path of the
squirrel, so that, when the beam was crossed, the squirrel took its
own photo. Special high speed flash units, working on 3500 volts,
were used to light the subject. A multi-flash system was sometimes
used to produce three images in quick succession. A medium format
film camera with 150 mm lens was used for the photos. It was left
overnight, occasionally resulting in more than one photo per
night. Several weeks of work were necessary to achieve the series of
shots.</p>

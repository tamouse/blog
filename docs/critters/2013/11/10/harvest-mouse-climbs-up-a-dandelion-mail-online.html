<p>Cutest wee little mousie climbing a dandelion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As this tiny harvest mouse seemed to blow away a dandelion, who
knows what it was wishing for.
These heartwarming pictures of one of Britain’s most elusive rodents
were taken by amateur photographer Matt Binstead last weekend.
He said: ‘It was lovely to get these shots of the mouse in its
element. I saw it on the stem and just waited for it to climb all
the way to the top.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘I can’t remember whether it was the breeze or the mouse blowing the
dandelion.
‘It is the only British animal with what is known as a prehensile
tail that can be used as a fifth limb.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘When wrapped around a stem, it can act as a brake or anchor.
‘This makes it very nimble, travelling and feeding in stems of
cereals and grasses.’
Conservation measures have been in place for the species since 2001
when it was given near-threatened status.
It is Europe’s smallest rodent, at about 6cm long, and weighs less
than a 2p coin.
They have many natural predators and are a snack for foxes, weasels,
stoats, cats, owls, crows, kestrels and even toads.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mouse is Europe’s smallest rodent, at about 6cm long, and weighs
less than a 2p coin.
And many of them freeze to death in the winter where they live in
grass nests in hedgerows near the ground.
The species don’t hibernate but do sleep for long periods in the
winter, waking up during milder spells to eat a little stored food
or venture out on a foraging trip.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tennis balls used in play at Wimbledon have been recycled to create
artificial nests for harvest mice in an attempt to help the species
avoid predation at this time.
They eat mainly seeds and insects but also nectar and fruit and are
found in areas of tall grasses such as cereal crops, and in roadside
verges, hedgerows, reedbeds, dykes and salt-marshes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mr Binstead, 30, is head keeper at the British Wildlife Centre in
Lingfield, Surrey, where the pictures were taken.
He added: ‘They have a remarkable ability to sense vibrations
through the soles of their feet.
‘Larger animals in the vicinity can be sensed by vibrations passing
through the ground and up the plant on which the mouse is feeding.’</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Harvest mice breed from May to October, often producing three
litters a year after a two-and-a-half-week gestation period.
The young are completely independent and are abandoned by their
mother after 16 days.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The centre has been open to the public since 2000 and houses about
40 native species.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe this little one was just wishing the lovely weather will
continue.</p>

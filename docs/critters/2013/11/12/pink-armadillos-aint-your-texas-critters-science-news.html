  <p><strong>DIGGING DIRT</strong>  Pink fairy armadillos have claws so specialized for digging that they struggle to walk on hard surfaces.</p>

  <p>Here’s an Internet bizarrity that you can believe in: the pink fairy
armadillo.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s a real animal, the smallest armadillo species in the world. At
about 100 grams, it would fit in your hands. It’s covered with “very
fine, silky white hair,” says Mariella Superina of the CONICET
research center in Mendoza, Argentina. And its hard outer covering,
rich in blood vessels, can blush pink.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Full details of <em>Chlamyphorus truncatus</em> biology, though, might as
well be a fairy tale. It’s known only from a dry, sandy swath of
Argentina and spends most of its time underground. The pink fairy is
so hard to spot that Superina and her colleagues are struggling to
determine whether it’s endangered or not. She heads an international
group of specialists now trying to assess the risk of extinction for
the world’s 21 known armadillo species, plus their close relatives,
the sloths and anteaters.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 10 years of field work, she has never caught sight of the pink
species in the wild. She has seen tracks made by digging claws and
the diamond-shaped tip of its tail. After several meters, the tracks
just stop where, she presumes, the armadillo disappeared
underground. Locals, she says, “can track down any animal — except
the pink fairy armadillo.” Occasionally someone captures one and
soon panics about keeping it alive. These rare captives, she
reports, usually live no more than about eight days.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Superina struggled to care for one such stray that couldn’t be
returned to the wild. In 2011, she published a<em>Zoo Biology</em> paper
largely about what it wouldn’t eat. In desperation, she discovered
that it would slurp up a goop (consisting of milk, cat food and
exactly half a banana) that had been mixed for a different
species. The next stray fairy, though, wouldn’t touch the
stuff. (Don’t even think of getting one as a pet, she says.)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>During the eight months the goop-tolerant fairy lived in Superina’s
home terrarium, infrared cameras recorded it moving below the sand
surface. Biologists had thought the species “swims” through
sand. No, Superina now says. “It was very funny — it digs and then
it backs up and compacts the sand with its butt plate.” The video
shows a pale, furry body digging and butting, digging and
butting. The flattened round rear plate used in compaction is unique
to fairy armadillos.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This rare glimpse may have solved a paleontological mystery, too:
Previously found rows of compacted earth discs that look like
slumping sliced bread may actually be the work of ancient fairy
armadillos’ butt plates.</p>

<p>Story of a baby squirrel found nearly frozen, but revived and nursed to health by a kind redditor.</p>

<h1 id="he-was-found-freezing-and-dying-yet-somehow-the-last-photo-made-my-entire-year">He Was Found Freezing And Dying. Yet Somehow The Last Photo Made My Entire Year.</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.viralnova.com/found-freezing/">original</a></p>

<p>When <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/iamcleverhoneybadger">one man</a> found a
small squirrel freezing in the cold, he knew he just couldn’t let him
stay out in the elements on his own. So, he scooped the little guy up,
took him home and took part in the most adorable recovery process the
Internet has ever seen. (Seriously, try to <em>not</em> squeal when you see
these pictures.)</p>

<p>The baby squirrel was curled up, wasn’t moving and was freezing in the
cold.</p>

<p>The hero immediately scooped him up and put him in the nice, glove-lined
cup holder inside of his car.</p>

<p>Little squirrel, now out of the elements, had a cozy home.</p>

<p>He adored this little round home.</p>

<p>His first feeding.</p>

<p>The tiny squirrel was so young, his eyes weren’t opened yet.</p>

<p>This is where he met his new doggie parents.</p>

<p>They were excited to welcome a new furry buddy into the family.</p>

<p>And give big, wet, sloppy kisses to him.</p>

<p>Like father, like son!</p>

<p>Dogs make much better trees than you’d think.</p>

<p>It would be hard not to cuddle this cutie daily.</p>

<p>Especially once he mastered the art of dog-back riding.</p>

<p>He’s part of the pack now.</p>

<p>Possibly even the leader.</p>

<p>And now, he is king of the internet!</p>

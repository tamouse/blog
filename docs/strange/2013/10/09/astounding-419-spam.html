<p>(woo! a legit URL!)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your attention is needed immediately</p>

  <p>We have been informed through our global intelligence monitoring
 network that the sum of $10.500, 000.00, has been released from a
 bank in Africa bearing your name as the beneficiary without dist
 certificate to clear your name and fund from every terrorist or
 drug or money laundering activities</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, what number is that, really?</p>

<p>$10.500, 000.00</p>

<p>ten-fifty?</p>

<p>Ten dollars and fifty cents?</p>

<p>Woot! Next round of keystone on me!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We sincerely apologize for sending you this sensitive information
 via e-mail instead of a certified mail, phone call or a
 face-to-face conversation,We will also send you a certified email
 later it is due to the urgency and importance of the security
 information needed. To checkmate financial recklessness, illegal
 gambling, racketeering and considering the effect of the global
 financial crisis rocking the United States, our government with the
 help of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I) Washington, DC
 and the internet crime complaint center (ic3),alongside the CIA
 signed an agreement with U.K  police for an immediate release of
 all overdue funds presently logged in their treasury and to ensure
 it is disbursed to the rightful beneficiaries in all parts of the
 world. If you the beneficiary would adhere to our instruction it
 will help you receive your payment  immediately</p>

  <p>The bank knowing fully well that they do not have enough facilities
 to make this payment from any part of the world to your account
 directly, used what we know as a secret diplomatic transit payment
 (s.d.t.p) method to make the payment. direct transfers are
 difficult and secret diplomatic transit payment (s.d.t.p) are not
 usually made unless the funds are  related to terrorist activities
 and we ask why must your payment be made in  a secret transfer if
 your transaction  is legitimate.</p>

  <p>We do not want you to get into trouble as soon as these funds
 reflect in your personal account, so it is our duty as an
 international agency to correct these little problems before this
 fund reflects into your personal account.</p>

  <p>we advise you to contact us immediately, as your funds have been
 stopped and are being held in our custody, until you are able to
 provide us with the dist certificate within 3 days from the country
 that authorized the transfer to certify that the funds that you are
 about to receive are terrorist/drug free or we shall have cause to
 impound the payment and subsequently prosecute you for cross border
 terrorist financial activites.</p>

  <p>based on our findings, our investigative department wish to warn you
 against some miscreants, hoodlums and touts who go about scamming
 innocent people by claiming to be who they are not and thereby
 tarnishing the image of this wonderful country. By sending out
 fraudulent emails without our official logo and emblem we shall
 release your funds immediately we receive this legal document and
 we will ensure that you receive your payment without any further
 delay.</p>

  <p>Note</p>

  <p>We decided to contact you directly by email to acquire the proper
 verifications and proof from you to show that you are the rightful
 person to receive this fund, because of the huge amount
 involved. Be informed that the funds are now with a top bank in the
 united state in your name and under the monitoring/custody of the
 FBI. At the moment, we have asked the bank not to release the fund
 to anybody that comes to them, unless we instruct them to do so,
 and only if we receive the dist certificate this is to enable us
 carry out a comprehensive investigation first before releasing the
 fund to you.</p>

  <p>hence, you are to forward your  dist certificate to us immediately</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One has to wonder what a “dist certificate” might be…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if you have it in your possession, if you do not have it, then  let
 us know so that we will direct you  to the  appropriate  authority
 to  obtain the certificate then you are to send  it to our
 office. And thereafter, we will instruct the bank holding the
 funds, to go ahead and credit your account immediately. If you fail
 to provide the documents to this office, we will prosecute you and
 take appropriate action against you for not proving the legality of
 the funds.</p>

  <p>Finally if you truly want to receive this funds without F.B.I
 troubles then reconfirm the following below</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I am already having FBI troubles…</p>

  <p>Name………………………………….<br />
Address………………………………….<br />
Sex………………………………….<br />
Age………………………………….<br />
Contact number………………………………….<br />

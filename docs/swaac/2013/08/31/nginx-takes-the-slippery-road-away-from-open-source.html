  <h1 id="nginx-takes-the-slippery-road-away-from-open-source-print-title">Nginx takes the slippery road away from open source {.print-title}</h1>

  <p>By Simon Phipps</p>

  <p>Created <em>2013-08-23 05:43AM</em></p>

  <p>Riding the wave of its broad adoption, the eponymous company behind the
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/t/application-servers/nginx-overtakes-microsoft-no-2-web-server-183079">open source Nginx Web server</a> [1] took a turn to the proprietary this week and <a href="http://news.techworld.com/applications/3465208/nginx-web-server-goes-commercial-with-new-release/">announced a paid-only edition called Nginx plus</a>
[2]. Nginx is popular as a simpler, high-performance server and is often
used as a proxy load balancing other server software, as well as for
embedded use.</p>

  <p>The company had previously relied for revenue on large-scale and
embedded deployers looking for expert skills, but this move signals a
switch to an “open core” model. The move provoked widespread dismay in
the free and open source software communities; Apache HTTPD veteran and
Apache board member <a href="https://twitter.com/jimjag/status/370617704828637184">Jim Jagielski’s comment</a> [3]
deducing the proprietary is now the most important codebase for the
company was one of the milder examples.</p>

  <p>Of course, others couldn’t understand that reaction; one voice
<a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/370705322182078465">said</a> [7],
“Nginx offers premium support to companies it is making millions for,
gets hit w/ fountain of nerdrage because they’re somehow less free now.”
But the switch to open core definitely diminishes the commercial value
of open source software; “freedom” is not just conceptual. By
withholding the flexibility to use for any purpose, study the source,
adapt the software, and pass to anyone without permission, Nginx has
paradoxically lowered its value.</p>

  <p><strong>Why open core is worth less</strong>
Consider the general case. When any business uses this model, they have
an open source “community edition” of their software product, which
lacks many features of the commercial versions. It is indeed freely
available under an open source license and fully functional. There will
be many happy deployers of this version. If this was the only version
available, there would be no issues.</p>

  <p>The proprietary versions are significantly different from the community
version, perhaps with both the user interface and the functions. While
paid licensees are often entitled to source access to this version, the
proprietary licence is not perpetual – if the customer ends their
relationship with the vendor, they lose the right to use this version.</p>

  <p>Since this version significantly differs from the community version,
there is no fallback plan, and while the customer may have access to
their data (if the vendor is sufficiently enlightened about open data),
there’s no software they can continue to use. They are unable to trade
time for money, to use Mårten Mickos’ famous explanation – they are
locked in, and the open source core of the proprietary version delivers
no freedom to them.</p>

  <p>If this latter situation was described as “proprietary” (or avoided
association with open source, as for example IBM’s WebSphere does in its
embedding of Apache HTTPD) there would be no practical issues either. If
it’s clear you’re surrendering your flexibility in return for
convenience, that’s your choice.</p>

  <p>The fact is, the community edition and the commercial editions have
disjointed user bases. The community edition is used by a group of
people who have the time and skills to deploy by themselves and who have
no need of the many differences of the commercial versions. The
commercial versions are feature-rich and effectively lock their users
into a traditional commercial ISV relationship with the vendor. If these
two were kept distinct, there would probably be no pragmatic issue.
(Naturally, free-software advocates would still protest the existence of
closed code, but that’s not a part of this particular argument.)</p>

  <p>But a vendor that mixes these two encourages exactly the market
confusion that OSI was designed to minimize. If they claim to be an open
source business and use the presence of the community edition as a
credential to sell the proprietary versions, they wrap themselves in the
open source flag and their actions are exactly the gaming of the
maturity of open source that I believe should be challenged.</p>

  <p>Will Nginx try to wrap itself in the reputation of its previous good
open source citizenry while encouraging its customers to do without the
flexibility of open source? Time will tell, but I strongly encourage the
company to avoid this trap.</p>

<h1>Jekyllizing My Cookbook</h1>
Aug 26, 2013


</header>

<p>Today’s fun was working with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, the static
site generator that underlies <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> and
<a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>. I have a cookbook online on
my <a href="http://wiki.tamaratemple.com/Recipes/HomePage">wiki</a>. I am
starting to look at moving off that wiki and building the information
there as a static web site instead, as part of my migration away from
managing a server as I said in my
<a href="/blog/2013/05/15/introduction/">introduction</a>.</p>

<p>Today was fun and interesting learning how to work with Jekyll itself
and finding out what I might be able to do with it.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="where-to-start">Where To Start?</h2>

<p>I knew I was going to go with a static site generator, but which one?
I have been using Octopress here on the github pages, but did I want
to create another github pages project blog for something that didn’t
really have a project associated with it? Plus, how to generate the
gh-pages themselves. I know octopress can do that, but I also am
wanting to use non-blog pages, and wanted to learn more about Jekyll
itself.</p>

<p>So Jekyll it is.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-organize-things">How to Organize Things?</h2>

<p>I still haven’t quite gotten this fully fleshed out, but for now, I
have pages starting from the root directory, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">recipes/</code> and
subdirectories for the major types of food: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main-dishes</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">side-dishes</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">baked-goods</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>I envision that under each of the directories and subdirectories, I
will generate and index.html page containining links to the
subdirectories and files within it. Should be interesting! I will have
to write this by hand, obviously, as well as whatever feeds might be
involved here, but I probably won’t do that as such. (Although feeds
might be a reason to go back to posting recipes instead and using
categories. Hmm.)</p>

<h2 id="writing-a-liquid-tag">Writing a Liquid Tag</h2>

<p>Jekyll has a liquid tag that lets you write the link to a post by just
giving it’s slug name: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">post_url</code>. There isn’t one for getting the
page’s url given it’s slug, so I wrote one. That was fun and a good
learning, though I had to embed lots of debug prints to see what was
going on. I didn’t want to debug with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pry</code> as it involved too many
loops and steps.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-deploy">Where to Deploy?</h2>

<p>Despite my reluctance to run a server, I still have 3 of them (!?!?)
and so I’m putting the recipes under my server at tamouse.org on
Gandi. I have that set up to quickly add domains and subdomains, and
letting it serve up the static files will be neat. I’m currently
saving the generated files in the git repo; I may change my mind later
and remove them, and make sure the generate the pages on the remote
site during an update, which I may automate with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chef-solo</code> which I
am also playing with.</p>

<h2 id="but-wait-theres-more">But Wait, There’s More!</h2>

<p>While working on both this blog and the recipe blog at the same time,
I found myself having to remember to shut down the preview servers
going back and forth.</p>

<p>And then <strong>POW</strong> it hit me: Use POW.</p>

<h2 id="pow">POW</h2>

<p><a href="http://pow.cx/">POW</a> is a powerful little gizmo for the mac that
lets you have multiple Rack applications underway in development at
the same time, without having the bindings collide.</p>

<p>After you install it, all you have to do is symlink your application
to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.pow/</code> directory, and then you can point your browser at the
symlink name plus <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.dev</code>. So cool!</p>

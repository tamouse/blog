<h1>This is why I don't like sites like codeacademy</h1>
Dec 20, 2013


</header>

<p>The biggest problem I have with sites like
<a href="http://codeacademy.ocm">CodeAcademy</a> is shown in the following
screenshot:</p>

<p><img src="/images/codeacademy-issue.jpg" alt="CodeAcademy Lesson" title="Issue with how you can't really code in on-line learning sites" /></p>

<p>The problem is that you <em>must</em> enter exactly what the lesson is
expecting, regardless of whether what you want to enter is correct, or
even better than what they are expecting. I don’t think these sort of
sites teach people how to code so much as they teach limited
memorization, and how to work the interface.</p>

<p>Coding is about solving problems, learning how to solve problems, and
to explore, invent, and play. These sites hamper that, and thus don’t
provide the real learning environment needed.</p>

<p>Sites like <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> go about things in
a different way. You write your code, assert it works and submit it to
a forum. This way, there isn’t a single way of writing the code, but
the learner is left to learn and explore in creating their answers,
and has the benefit of learning from others work at the same
time. This is democratic learning. It doesn’t work for everyone,
certainly, but to me is the best way to learn to become a
craftsperson. The interest, curiosity, desire, and sharing that are
necessary for software crafting are rewarded.</p>

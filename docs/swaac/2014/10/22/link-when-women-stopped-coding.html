  <p>Modern computer science is dominated by men. But it hasn’t always been
this way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lot of computing pioneers — the people who programmed the first
digital computers — were women. And for decades, the number of women
studying computer science was growing faster than the number of men. But
in 1984, something changed. The percentage of women in computer science
flattened, and then plunged, even as the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf13327/content.cfm?pub_id=4266&amp;id=2">share of women in other technical and professional fields</a>
kept rising.</p>

  <p>What happened?</p>

  <p>We spent the last few weeks trying to answer this question, and there’s
no clear, single answer.</p>

  <p>But here’s a good starting place: The share of women in computer science
started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers
started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.</p>

  <p>These early personal computers weren’t much more than toys. You could
play pong or simple shooting games, maybe do some word processing. And
these toys were marketed
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CDkHs4lzUo">almost</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxNjx_VWJ8U">entirely</a> to men and boys.</p>

  <p>This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative. It became the
story we told ourselves about the computing revolution. It helped define
who geeks were and it created techie culture.</p>

  <p>Movies like Weird Science, Revenge of the Nerds, and War Games all came
out in the ’80s. And the plot summaries are almost interchangeable:
awkward geek boy genius uses tech savvy to triumph over adversity and
win the girl.</p>

  <p>In the 1990s, a researcher named <a href="http://gseis.ucla.edu/directory/jane-margolis/">Jane Margolis</a>interviewed
hundreds of computers science students at Carnegie Mellon, which had one
of the top programs in the country. She found that families were much
more likely to buy computers for boys than for girls — even when their
girls were really interested in computers.</p>

  <p>This was a big deal when those kids got to college. As personal
computers became more common, computer science professors increasingly
assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home.</p>

  <p>Patricia Ordóñez didn’t have a computer at home, but she was a math wiz
in school.</p>

  <p>“My teacher realized I was really good at solving problems, so she
pulled me and this other boy out to do special math,” she says. “We did
math instead of recess!”</p>

  <p>So when Ordóñez got to Johns Hopkins in the ’80s, she figured she would
study computer science or electrical engineering. Then she took her
first intro class — and found that most of her male classmates were way
ahead of her because they’d grown up playing with computers.</p>

  <p>“I remember this one time I asked a question and and the professor
stopped and looked at me and said, ‘You should know that by now,” she
recalls. “And I thought ‘I am never going to excel.’”</p>

  <p>In the ’70s, that never would have happened: Professors in intro classes
assumed their students came in with no experience. But by the ’80s, that
had changed.</p>

  <p>Ordóñez got through the class but earned the first C in her life. She
eventually dropped the program and majored in foreign languages.</p>

  <p>More than a decade later, though, she returned to computers. She found a
mentor, and eventually got a PhD in computer science. Now she’s an
assistant professor of computer science at the University of Puerto
Rico.</p>

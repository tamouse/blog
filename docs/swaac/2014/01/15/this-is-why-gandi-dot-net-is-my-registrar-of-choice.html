<h1>This is why Gandi.Net is my Registrar of Choice</h1>
Jan 15, 2014


</header>

<p>I have been trying to flee the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/07/12/godaddy_shuts_down_nodaddy/">Large US Internet Registrar and Hosting
company</a> for the past year or more. <a href="http://gandi.net">Gandi.Net</a> has been my
registrar of choice for a few years now, and I run a VPS from them as
well.</p>

<p>My experiences with Gandi have all been pretty wonderful, unlike my
experiences the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/07/12/godaddy_shuts_down_nodaddy/">LUSIR</a>.</p>

<p>This month’s newsletter from Gandi gives me even more reason to cheer
them, and to continue to recommend them to my friends, colleagues, and
others:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>##Feb 11: The Day We Fight Back Against Mass Surveillance</p>

  <p>Gandi has always stood up for digital due process, online privacy, and
electronic freedom. We support the EFF, and have always worked to
protect the Internet for free expression and open communication. As part
of the Internet Infrastructure Coalition (i2coalition.com), we are
actively lobbying the US Congress for reasonable reform of CFAA, the law
that activist Aaron Schwartz was charged under.</p>

  <p>We feel it is important to speak out for your online rights, and to help
our lawmakers make laws that enhance security while preserving our
freedom of expression. On Feb 11, we will join Mozilla, the EFF, Fight
for the Future, Gandi.net, and others in advocating for more reasonable
laws to protect our rights, and the rights of activists and
whistleblowers.</p>

  <p>See: https://thedaywefightback.org</p>

  <p>##A Conference of One’s Own: She’s Geeky</p>

  <p>Fighting injustice is hard enough when you have a clear target, and
things like pervasive microinequities are anything but. Sometimes, the
most effective way to deal with a failing system is to build your own
alternative. We applaud this spirit, and that’s why we’re proud to
support and participate in safe, friendly spaces in IT like the Bay Area
She’s Geeky unConference, happening Fri-Sun, January 24-26, 2014 in
Mountain View, CA.</p>

  <p>Gandi’s delegation is excited to attend. If you see us there, be sure to
say hi! We’d love to chat.</p>

  <p>For more information or to sponsor She’s Geeky, see www.shesgeeky.org.
And by the way, if you know of an event you think we’d be into, let us
know at newsletter-en@gandi.net.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More now than before, Gandi seems to be a company that actually is
capable of showing concern and care for people, and not just out to
rake in money.</p>

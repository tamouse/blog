<h1>Playing Around with Thor Generators</h1>
Mar 8, 2014


</header>

<p>Automating things has been somewhat of a life goal for me. Ultimately,
I’m a pretty lazy person, and I hate to have to do things
repetitively, and if I can get the computer to do it for me, I’ll
write a script. (Although I admit this sometimes devolves into
<a href="#">Yak shaving</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="so-what-is-a-generator">so what is a generator?</h2>

<p>Simply put, a generator is something that builds something else for
further use. Sometimes this is referred to as a factory if you’re
doing it in code. But here, I’m taking the meaning of creating files
and directories, with possibly customized content, that will be used
to frame in a bit of a coding project.</p>

<p><a href="http://whatisthor.com">Thor</a> is a nifty tool that was extracted from
Rails to be a stand-alone tool. Generators are tools that build other
things, typically used in Rails for models, controllers, and so on,
but generators can live anywhere. Thor is also a very viable
alternative to <a href="http://davetron5000.github.com/methadone/">methadone</a>
or <a href="http://davetron5000.github.io/gli/">GLI</a>, which are both very
awesome and worthy starting points (and generators in their own
right!). In fact, I owe <em>a lot</em> to Dave Copeland
<a href="https://github.com/davetron5000">@davetron on Github</a> for
his super awesome ideas and directions on making cli applications in
Ruby.</p>

<h2 id="generating--what">generating – what?</h2>

<p>I have often started off a learning exercise by creating a gem skeleton
with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundler</code> :</p>

<p>gist 9439598 bundler-gem</p>

<p>This is itself a generator, and rather a cool way to start something
up. However, it’s intended to create an actual gem, which I don’t
necessarily want to do, especially if it’s something I’m trying to
learn, or demonstrate, or somehow work out, but not something I’m
going to publish in [rubygems][rubygems].</p>

<p>So what would I generate, exactly, and how?</p>

<h2 id="a-typical-project-directory">A typical project directory</h2>

<p>Below is a typical project directory structure I like for starting
out:</p>

<p>gist 9439598 directory-structure</p>

<p>Several of these might remain empty or unused, but it’s a great
starting point for me. If I do wish to turn it into a gem, All I need
do is add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gemspec</code> file.</p>

<h1 id="gems">gems</h1>

<p>I also have my favourite set of gems that I like to start out with:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rspec</code> - my testing framework of choice</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">guard</code> - for continuous testing</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">guard-rspec</code> - to watch rspec tests</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">guard-bundler</code> - to watch changes to Gemfile</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pry</code> - my REPL of choice</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pry-nav</code> - nice navigation inside pry</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pry-git</code> - link to git for blaming code</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pry-doc</code> - link to internal documentation</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pry-remote</code> - to attach to a remote ruby process</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pry-rescue</code> - to jump into the pry REPL if an exception happens</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pry-byebug</code> - debugger for ruby MRI 2.x</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pry-stack_explorer</code> - to jump up down or sideways in the execution stack</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">awesome_print</code> - really nice looking output, integrated into pry</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rb-readline</code> - a necessary evil running on the Mac</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">coolline</code> - nice colouriser</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">coderay</code> - syntax highlighting on the fly in pry</li>
</ul>

<p>These are in the Gemfile in a default group. If I were to release the
project as something, I’d move these into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:development</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:test</code> groups.</p>

<h2 id="continuous-testing-with-guard">continuous testing with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">guard</code></h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/guard/guard">Guard</a> is a fabulous system that
builds on <em>top</em> of <a href="http://pryrepl.org">pry</a> that watches various
directories and reruns tests (or other commands if you set it up
to). I have the Guardfile in the generator, though, because
out-of-the-box <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">guard-rspec</code> does not run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rspec</code> bundled, and I’m
nearly <em>always</em> running under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundler</code>.</p>

<p>The modification is simple:</p>

<p>gist 9439598 Guardfile</p>

<p>You add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:cmd</code> to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rspec</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">watch</code> section. But it’s just one more thing to have
to remember and slow me down.</p>

<p>A difference between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle gem</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">guard-rspec</code> is that the former
expects spec tests to live directly under the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spec/</code> directory, while
the latter figures the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib/</code> structure is mirrored under
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spec/</code>. This isn’t such a big deal, but it is one more thing to think
about, and I’m often puzzled why things don’t work. (Convention over
configuration, perhaps not enough time spent together.)</p>

<h2 id="so-what-about-thor-again">so what about thor, again?</h2>

<p>Thor seems all about generating things. Included in
<a href="http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Thor::Actions</code></a>
are some really useful items for copying, converting, templating, and
so on. There are also commands for interacting with the user, should
that prove necessary.</p>

<p>Here’s the new project generator:</p>

<p>gist 9439598 new_ruby_project.thor</p>

<p>Let’s talk a bit about this script.</p>

<h3 id="thorgroup">Thor::Group</h3>

<p>The first thing we make is the class declaration for our thor
command. The class inherits from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Thor::Group</code> instead of from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Thor</code>
proper. This causes the defined methods to be executed in order,
rather than creating individual sub-commands, as is the case when you
inherit from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Thor</code>. This essentially turns the command into a script,
which is how we usually want things done in a generator.</p>

<h3 id="thoractions">Thor::Actions</h3>

<p>We include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Thor::Actions</code> in our class to give us the useful tools
for interacting with the user (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">say</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ask</code>, etc ), as well as the
building tools, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create_file</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">copy_file</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">template</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>In this generator, I’m using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">template</code> nearly everywhere, as it
copies a source file with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ERB</code> directives in it and writes out the
result to the destination.</p>

<h3 id="argument-name">argument :name</h3>

<p>This is telling thor to expect one argument upon invocation, in this
case, the name of the new ruby project.</p>

<h3 id="def-selfsource_root">def self.source_root</h3>

<p>Thor::Action arguments typically follow the convention of source,
destination, and options, with passing a block if there are further
things that need to be done.</p>

<p>The source is determined by the class method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source_root</code>. The
default method ends up using the current working directory as the
source root. Redefining the class method permits the author to specify
a completely different directory to use as the source root folder.</p>

<p>In this case, I’ve specified the skeleton directory for new projects,
which looks like that above.</p>

<h3 id="def-name_components">def name_components</h3>

<p>This is doing a bit of munging on potential input from the user. It’s
quite possible to put pretty much anything as the first argument, but
what we really only want are the alpha-numeric bits, which we will
consider as project name components.</p>

<p>Supplying things like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Able &amp; Louis: Go @@CRAXY@@</code> would end up as
name components <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">["Able", "Louis", "Go", "CRAXY"]</code>. The components are
used by later methods to construct useful names for things.</p>

<h3 id="def-snake_name">def snake_name</h3>

<p>Here’s one now: out of something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">["Able", "Louis", "Go", "CRAXY"]</code>, 
would come <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">able_louis_go_craxy</code>, which is a very nice name for files
and directories, where this is usually used.</p>

<h3 id="def-camel_name">def camel_name</h3>

<p>The other method using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name_components</code>, this will produce
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AbleLouisGoCraxy</code> which gives us our useful module name.</p>

<h3 id="def-copy_files">def copy_files</h3>

<p>This picks up the files that we want to transfer to the root directory
of the new project, translates them, and writes them to the
destination’s root.</p>

<h3 id="def-dot_files">def dot_files</h3>

<p>These are the “hidden” files in a directory, that begin with a “.” but
are so useful. These are picked up from the source, translated, and
saved to the destination with a “.” pre-pended.</p>

<h3 id="def-other_file">def other_file</h3>

<p>The rest of the project is translated and saved into the appropriate
places.</p>

<h2 id="what-else">what else?</h2>

<p>This is still pretty blunt and could use some work to make it even
more useful. It works for me now quite well. Here are some additional
ideas:</p>

<h3 id="use-a-manifest">use a manifest</h3>

<p>Instead of hard-coding the source file names in the methods, create a
manifest that lists what files should be moved from which locations to
which destinations. I think a YAML file would do this quite nicely.</p>

<h3 id="allow-a-different-skeleton">allow a different skeleton</h3>

<p>Instead of nailing the skeleton inside the thor script, pass it in as
a parameter.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-sure-ive-reimplemented-the-wheel">I am sure I’ve reimplemented the wheel…</h2>

<p>…but I am learning from doing this. There have been many ways to
make gems, command line applications, web applications, and so on. I
can see using this to build jekyll pages, or an entry for a new art
project I’m working on to collect images, notes, etc.</p>

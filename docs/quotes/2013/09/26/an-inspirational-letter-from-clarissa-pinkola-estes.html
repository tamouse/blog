<h1>An inspirational letter from Clarissa Pinkola Estes</h1>
Sep 26, 2013

<p><a href="http://www.clarissapinkolaestes.com/">Clarissa Pinkola Estes</a> wrote
the following essay, but I don’t know when or where I acquired it. It
shows up many places on the web, but I can’t seem to find the original
in order to cite it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is inspirational and well worth reading (or
re-reading).</p>

<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>

<p>by Clarissa Pinkola Estes</p>

<p>My friends, do not lose heart. We were made for these times. I have
heard from so many recently who are deeply and properly
bewildered. They are concerned about the state of affairs in our world
right now.</p>

<p>Ours is a time of almost daily astonishment and often righteous rage
over the latest degradations of what matters most to civilized,
visionary people.</p>

<p>You are right in your assessments. The lustre and hubris some have
aspired to while endorsing acts so heinous against children, elders,
everyday people, the poor, the unguarded, the helpless, is
breathtaking. Yet, I urge you, ask you, gentle you, to please not
spend your spirit dry by bewailing these difficult times. Especially
do not lose hope. Most particularly because, the fact is that we were
made for these times.</p>

<p>Yes. For years, we have been learning, practicing, been in training
for and just waiting to meet on this exact plain of engagement…</p>

<p>I grew up on the Great Lakes and recognize a seaworthy vessel when I
see one. Regarding awakened souls, there have never been more able
vessels in the waters than there are right now across the world. And
they are fully provisioned and able to signal one another as never
before in the history of humankind… Look out over the prow; there
are millions of boats of righteous souls on the waters with you. Even
though your veneers may shiver from every wave in this stormy world, I
assure you that the long timbers composing your prow and rudder come
from a greater forest. That long-grained lumber is known to withstand
storms, to hold together, to hold its own, and to advance, regardless.</p>

<p>In any dark time, there is a tendency to veer toward fainting over how
much is wrong or unmended in the world. Do not focus on that. There is
a tendency, too, to fall into being weakened by dwelling on what is
outside your reach, by what cannot yet be. Do not focus there. That is
spending the wind without raising the sails. We are needed, that is
all we can know. And though we meet resistance, we more so will meet
great souls who will hail us, love us and guide us, and we will know
them when they appear. Didn’t you say you were a believer?  Didn’t you
say you pledged to listen to a voice greater?  Didn’t you ask for
grace?  Don’t you remember that to be in grace means to submit to the
voice greater?…</p>

<p>Ours is not the task of fixing the entire world all at once, but of
stretching out to mend the part of the world that is within our reach.</p>

<p>Any small, calm thing that one soul can do to help another soul, to
assist some portion of this poor suffering world, will help
immensely. It is not given to us to know which acts or by whom, will
cause the critical mass to tip toward an enduring good. What is needed
for dramatic change is an accumulation of acts, adding, adding to,
adding more, continuing.</p>

<p>We know that it does not take “everyone on Earth” to bring justice and
peace, but only a small, determined group who will not give up during
the first, second, or hundredth gale.</p>

<p>One of the most calming and powerful actions you can do to intervene
in a stormy world is to stand up and show your soul. Soul on deck
shines like gold in dark times. The light of the soul throws sparks,
can send up flares, builds signal fires, causes proper matters to
catch fire. To display the lantern of soul in shadowy times like these
– to be fierce and to show mercy toward others, both, are acts of
immense bravery and greatest necessity.</p>

<p>Struggling souls catch light from other souls who are fully lit and
willing to show it. If you would help to calm the tumult, this is one
of the strongest things you can do.</p>

<p>There will always be times when you feel discouraged. I too have felt
despair many times in my life, but I do not keep a chair for it; I
will not entertain it. It is not allowed to eat from my plate. The
reason is this: in my uttermost bones I know something, as do you. It
is that there can be no despair when you remember why you came to
Earth, who you serve, and who sent you here. The good words we say and
the good deeds we do are not ours: they are the words and deeds of the
One who brought us here. In that spirit, I hope you will write this on
your wall:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a great ship is in harbor and moored, it is safe, there can be
  no doubt. But that is not what great ships are built for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This comes with much love and a prayer that you remember who you came
from, and why you came to this beautiful, needful Earth.</p>

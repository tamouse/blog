<p>I’m not clear on the source of this (who is the “I” in this story) but
follows a story of Picasso’s reaction to receiving a telegram
requesting his support in an effort to stem a wave of anti-art
sentiment from American politicos.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One morning, soon after Miro had left, a special delivery letter
arrived from Kahnweiler in Paris. Enclosed with Kahnweiler’s letter
was a cable from New York.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We had been hearing wildly fantastic stories about American
congressmen fulminating against modern art as politically
subversive– the kind of rabble-rousing speech that Hitler used to
make in the thirties and that the Russians go in for now – the only
difference being that the American congressmen saw it all as part of
a Communist plot and the Russians call it “bourgeois decadence.” The
resistance to the lunatic fringe on this American subcultural front
apparently centered about the Museum of Modern Art in New York and
the cable was a real cri du coeur from the stoutly pumping heart of
that center of resistance. It was signed by the painter Stuart
Davis, the sculptor Lipchitz, and James Johnson Sweeney, at that
period director of painting and sculpture at the museum. It was
addressed to Pablo in care of Kahnweiler’s gallery and read:</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>SERIOUS WAVE OF ANIMOSITY TOWARDS FREE EXPRESSION PAINTING SCULPTURE
MOUNTING IN AMERICAN PRESS AND MUSEUMS STOP GRAVE RENEWED PRESSURE
FAVORING MEDIOCRE AND UTILITARIAN STOP ARTISTS WRITERS REAFFIRMING
RIGHTS HOLD MEETING MUSEUM MODERN ART MAY FIFTH STOP YOUR SUPPORT
WOULD MEAN MUCH TO ISSUE COULD CABLE STATEMENT EMPHASIZING NECESSITY
FOR TOLERATION OF INNOVATION IN ART TO SWEENEY 177 BROADWAY</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Attached to the message was a prepaid reply voucher. I translated
the cable for Pablo and then read him Kahnweiler’s
letter. Kahnweiler had read the cable before forwarding it –
“delirious” was his word for it. As far as the mounting wave
animosity toward free expression in art was concerned, Who cares?
Kahnweiler asked; nobody worries about people like that, he said. On
the other hand, maybe he was wrong and Pablo would feel it was
necessary to emphasize the necessity for the toleration of
innovation in art.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pablo shook his head. “Kahnweiler’s right,” he said. “The point is,
art is something subversive. It’s something that should not be
free. Art and liberty, like the fire of Prometheus, are things one
must steal, to be used against the established order. Once art
becomes official and open to everyone, then it becomes the new
academicism.” He tossed the cablegram down onto the table. “How can
I support an idea like that? If art is ever given the keys to the
city, it will be because it’s been so watered down, rendered
impotent, that it’s not worth fighting for.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I reminded him that Malherbe had said a poet is of no more use to
the state than a man who spends his time playing ninepins. “Of
course,” Pablo said. “And why did Plato say poets should be chased
out of the republic? Precisely because every poet and every artist
is an anti-social being. He’s not that way because he wants to be;
he can’t be any other way. Of course the state has the right to
chase him away– from its point of view– and if he is really an
artist it is in his nature not to want to be admitted, because if he
is admitted it can only mean he is doing something which is
understood, approved, and therefore old hat– worthless. Anything
new, anything worth doing, can’t be recognized. People just don’t
have that much vision. So this business about defending and freeing
culture is absurd. One can defend culture in a broad, general sense,
if you mean by that heritage of the past, but the right to free
expression is something one seizes, not something one is given. It
isn’t a principle one can lay down as something that should
exist. The only principle involved is that if it does exist, it
exists to be used against the established order. Only the Russians
are naive enough to think that an artist can fit into
society. That’s because they don’t know what an artist is. What can
the state do with the real artists, the seers? Rimbaud in Russia is
unthinkable. Even Mayakowsky committed suicide. There is absolute
opposition between the creator and the state. So there’s only one
tactic for the state– kill the seers. If the idea of society is to
dominate the idea of the individual, the individual must
perish. Furthermore, there wouldn’t be such a thing as a seer if
there weren’t a state trying to suppress him. It’s only at that
moment, under that pressure, that he becomes one. People reach the
status of artist only after crossing the maximum number of
barriers. So the arts should be discouraged, not encouraged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The thing that’s wrong with modern art right now,” he said, “and we
might as well say it– it’s dying– is the fact that there isn’t any
longer a strong, powerful academic art worth fighting against. There
has to be a rule even if it’s a bad one because evidence of art’s
power is breaking down the barriers. But to do away with obstacles–
that serves no purpose other than to make things completely
wishy-washy, spineless, shapeless, meaningless– zero.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pablo studied the prepaid answer form. “Well,” he said, “they wasted
their nine hundred and thirty-eight francs on me.” He tossed it into
the basket.</p>

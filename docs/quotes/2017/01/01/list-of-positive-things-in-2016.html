<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">With celebrity death and elections taking the media by the
nose, it’s easy to forget that this year saw a great many
positives. Let’s look.</p>&mdash; Chris Hadfield (@Cmdr_Hadfield) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield/status/815294057102667778">December

      <p>World hunger has reached its lowest point in 25 years, and with
poverty levels dropping worldwide, seems likely to continue.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The A.U. made strides to become more unified, launching an
all-Africa passport meant to allow for visa-free travel for all

disease.</p>

      <p>Manatees, arguably the most enjoyable animal to meet when
swimming, are no longer endangered.</p>

the world’s 65 million refugees doubling.</p>

donations have increased more than ten times since a decade ago.</p>
    </li>

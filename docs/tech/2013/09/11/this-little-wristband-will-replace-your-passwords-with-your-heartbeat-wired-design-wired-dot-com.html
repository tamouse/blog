  <p>Companies have been dangling the promise of hyper-connected smart
environments in front of us for years. We’ve been told that soon we’ll
be able to walk into a room, and our devices will instantly cater to our
preferences. In this world, Spotify has learned that you enjoy listening
to hip hop while making dinner, and your Jambox knows how loud you like
the volume. Upon entering your kitchen, the lights dim to a warm glow,
just the way you like it, and based on what you’ve indicated you’re
making for dinner via a cooking app, the oven presets to 400 degrees
with just a wave of your hand.</p>

  <p>Sounds pretty great, right? But the problem is, how do these devices
even know who’s there? Tailoring environments to our desires is reliant
on devices knowing and understanding the people who use them. But short
of manually programming your preferences, there’s no easy way for our
gadgets and apps to know who we are or what we like. “We see ourselves
as sort of the central point in enabling that in a really simple way,”
says Karl Martin, CEO of <a href="http://bionym.com/">Bionym</a>, a biometrics
company based in Toronto.</p>

  <p>Tailoring environments to our desires relies upon devices that know the
people using them.</p>

  <p>Martin an his team have created the Nymi, a plastic wristband that is
aiming to be the common thread that connects your identity to the smart
devices of the future. Born out of research done at the University of
Toronto, the device uses a biometric sensor to authenticate identity
through a person’s unique electrocardiogram. Which is a fancy way of
saying, the pattern of your heartbeat could be your new set of keys.</p>

  <p>The Bionym team found a way to extract features of your heartbeat that
allows them to create a robust biometric template. So if you get nervous
and your heart speeds up or you just ran a few miles, the waveform of
your heartbeat might appear more condensed, but it’s still essentially
the same pattern. The idea is that users will strap on the Nymi each
morning, touch the topside sensor to read their ECG and will be
constantly authenticated until they decide to take it off.</p>

  <p>Other devices like the NFC Ring and Motorola’s Skip are using near field
communication technology to do away with passwords and make the world
more wirelessly connected, but they don’t really take the individual
into account. Those devices are essentially like high-tech keys that if
lost, could theoretically be used by whoever found it.</p>

  <p>The Nymi’s biggest advantage (and biggest risk) is that it uses
biometrics to validate a user’s identity. This puts the Nymi in a
position to make personalization and identity more easily accessible
than ever before, but it also carries a massive responsibility for
protecting privacy. The band won’t work unless it detects your specific
ECG, so depending on how you intend to use it, it needs to be around
your wrist all day long. This allows for persistent authentication,
meaning you don’t have to continually touch a pad to register your
fingerprint or swipe a ring to open your front door. Depending on the
proximity determined by developers, you simply have to walk into a room
to engage with devices or apps. “If your identity is being used to
provide a personalized experience, the value of that is that you don’t
have to think about it,” Martin says. “If you had to enter things every
time, that’s not as valuable.”</p>

  <p>Martin believes the interactions between people and technology should be
passive, but not absent.</p>

  <p>Of course, wearing something all day every day is a lot to ask,
particularly because no one has gotten wearable technology quite right.
The Nymi looks a lot like the fitness trackers on the market: a
relatively inconspicuous rubber wristband with a sensor on the wrist and
at the top. Though it doesn’t scream “Look! Technology!” it’s certainly
not invisible. Bionym is toying with the form factor and has considered
making the Nymi into a necklace or embeddable into clothing. One thing
they’re not doing, is following the shiny smart watch trend. “You have
to think, ‘Well, what is it people are willing to accept?’” Martin says.
“There’s been so much talk about smart watches and how they’re the next
big thing, but nobody’s really justified why somebody would want to put
a big screen on their wrist. We’re following the philosophy that
wearable tech is less about the digital interaction with the user and
more about technology that melts into the background.”</p>

  <p>Martin believes the interactions between people and technology should be
passive, but not altogether absent. The most recent version of the Nymi
will communicate with users by little vibrations that let them know
their identity is being used or that the band is talking to other
devices. “The idea is that users want some awareness and it can be
really subtle,” he says. “But it goes toward this assurance of privacy
and security and this idea that it’s not doing things without you
knowing it.”</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.wired.com/design/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/bionym-1.jpeg"><img src="http://www.wired.com/images/1x1.trans.gif" alt="" title="bionym-1" /></a></p>

  <p><img src="http://www.wired.com/design/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/bionym-1.jpeg" alt="" title="bionym-1" /></p>

  <p>Privacy is a big concern for the Nymi, and you can imagine the company
is going to encounter some serious questions about the security of
wearing your biometric identity around your wrist. Typed passwords and
pin numbers can be discarded and easily changed, but if your ECG gets
into the wrong hands, that’s a big problem since you can’t exactly reset
your heartbeat. Martin says the Nymi was conceived with the idea of
“privacy by design,” which is basically Bionym’s policy of building a
product that’s rooted in keeping data protected. “There’s going to be
major pushback if users feel their privacy isn’t protected,” admits
Martin.</p>

  <p>The wristband uses a cryptographic chip, which means all data is
encrypted at the hardware level. And Martin says it’s impossible for
 anyone to trace the signal emitting from the wrist band back to the
user unless people opt-in to allow that access (the default setting is
opt-out).”Whenever there’s a new technology that people don’t
necessarily understand, there’s always going to be a backlash and fear,”
he says. ”It’s not immediately obvious, but this product is actually a
way for people to improve their privacy and take more control over their
information.”</p>

  <p>You can pre-order the Nymi for $79, but it’s not going into production
until spring of 2014. In the months leading up to the official launch,
Bionym’s main task is getting third-party developers on board to create
a thriving ecosystem of apps and devices that the Nymi can be used with.
Proving the Nymi’s value to other companies is the first step to this
new technology being adopted by the larger public. “There’s almost a
chicken and egg thing here,” Martin says. “You need a lot of people
[users] on board to make it justifiable for others to want to integrate,
and for people to want to get on board, they want to know that there’s a
lot of integration and that it will do a lot of things for them.”</p>

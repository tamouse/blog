  <p>Massive LEGO builds celebrating spirituality, peaceful ET contact and
fantastical worlds. First work: 200,000 LEGO pieces, 600+ hours.</p>

  <h1 id="the-contact-series">The Contact Series</h1>

  <p><strong>The Contact Series of LEGO built creations was designed to promote the
beauty of all intelligent life forms as extensions of our family –
children under the same creative force.</strong></p>

  <p>This is a story where human consciousness rediscovers the art of
intuition and the subtle – but powerful – forces of the universe. Here,
groups of modern humans use ancient rituals which – in combination with
expanded consciousness – initiates communication with the great space
faring cultures of the universe. Vectoring extraterrestrial beings to
their position on earth, these humans invite the visitors to help heal
the planet through the ETs’ transformative powers and bring the greater
Earth community closer to the spiritual nature of the universe.</p>

  <p>In the Contact Series, war, self interest and materialistic thinking are
products of the less evolved species – such as humans. While there are
others like us in the universe, the vast collection of sentient beings
spread throughout the universe have either evolved beyond this or never
had concepts as these in their culture.</p>

  <p>Understanding the spiritual nature and properties of the universe helps
societies to unlock powerful forces which greatly improve the quality of
life. The forces include out of body travel (astral travel), healing,
telepathy with all life forms (including plants and animals), weather
control, trans location, space travel, instant plant growth,
materialization of objects through sound and thought and much more.
Generally speaking, what we perceive as supernatural, paranormal or
miraculous are simply expressions of this power. The most spiritually
advanced of the cultures have evolved close to celestial.</p>

  <p>All advanced technologies dovetail into this spiritual story. For
example, traveling beyond home systems is only possible through a
combination of advanced electronics and consciousness expansion. Ships
are manufactured conscious entities which interface with star travelers.
Forged in the astral realm through pure tones, these living trans
dimensional transport vehicles fold out of linear space time allowing
for movement at the speed of consciousness – which is limitless.</p>

  <p>Now for the catch. In order to access and interface in this manner, one
must resonate at a high frequency (or of kindness). Malevolent levels of
consciousness simply cannot access this kind of advancement. For this
reason, interstellar war is not an option. Ships have no weapons.The
vast multitude of sentient, space faring races keep track of lower
evolved, spiritually empty races that enter atomic and space ages.
Quarantines are put up around such planets to maintain peace in local
areas of space. Missions to neutralize atomic weapons are part of the
quarantine process. And so it is with earth…</p>

  <p>Future ‘Contact’ works will feature celebrations of expanded
consciousness, loving and caring moments of ETs, contact events and
other celebration from our brothers and sisters throughout the universe.</p>

  <h1 id="first-work-the-millennial-celebration-of-the--eternal-choir-at-kal-yne-odan">First Work: The Millennial Celebration of the  Eternal Choir at K’al Yne, Odan</h1>

  <p>The series begins with Odan – one of the New Worlds. Like Earth, their
civilization is young – under two hundred thousand years old. Unlike
Earth, their species evolved from mammals that did not have inter
species killing. The concept of war and murder remained unknown to this
race as a result of these early evolutionary behaviors. This allowed for
the quick advancement along cultural and spiritual tracks.</p>

  <p>One of Odan’s great cultural icons is the Eternal Choir. Based in the
small, but ancient town of K’al Yne, the choir has been singing
uninterrupted for 1,000 years. Thousands of citizens participate a few
hours a day forming an atmosphere filled with music. Now, the millennial
celebration has come and visitors throughout this and many other
galaxies have come to witness the event. Like many of the Great Choirs,
music is sung both in the physical and astral. This has the effect of
purifying elements, such as soil, water and air, preventing illnesses
and promoting the growth of enhanced spiritual fruits – making for an
especially high standard of living.</p>

  <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/482/741/486320b6b93088d83255037cb0a8f65e_large.jpg?1364783668" alt="" /></p>

  <p>K’al Yne is a popular local galactic vacation spot. Visitors can expect
powerful spiritual food grown locally, wonderful astral vacation
chambers, beautiful meditation temples all in a charming small town
setting. While there are not as many physical activities here in K’al
Yne, the ancient town more than makes up for it with particularly
advanced astral vacation chambers. Here, visitors can enjoy long
assisted meditation sessions – which can last a few days to weeks –
while adventuring in a variety of exciting astral realms. These realms –
free of physical restraints – offer a heightened degree of intensity
(whether relaxing or adventuring) than can be found in the physical.</p>

  <p>The architecture in K’al Yne was modeled after many of the spiritual
centers from the old cultures in its galactic cluster. Buildings are
mostly windowless which keep night light pollution to a minimum – a must
for night meditation in the stars. “Windows” are projected through fiber
optic like devices which open entire walls up completely to the outside.
This technology brings in light, perfect views, cool breezes and the
sounds of the city.</p>

  <p><em>Dedicated to my parents, Mike and Mina, my wife Stephanie, my sons Ian
and Caeden, Rev. Howard Storm and Dr Steven Greer.</em></p>

  <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd_FUrC5aoA">Rev. Howard Storm</a> briefly
died in 1985 due a ruptured duodenum. It has been said that his account
of the afterlife and of after death evil spirits is the most complete
modern day description given. At the time an atheist, the experience had
such a powerful effect as to bring him into religious studies after the
event. His testimony offers a glimpse into the existence of other
intelligent beings and our relationship to them.</p>

  <p>Dr. Steven Greer, a former emergency room surgeon and transcendental
meditation instructor founded the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vyVe-6YdUk">Disclosure
Project</a> and global
Disclosure movement. The Disclosure Project confirms the reality of ET
visitations through testimonies collected from hundreds of credible
individuals – from astronauts and cosmonauts, pilots (commercial and
military), an FAA director, high ranking members of the CIA, contractors
with high security clearances to the military industrial complex, NASA,
JPL and on and on. These personal, firsthand accounts shed light on the
secrecy and intimidation brought on through the military industrial
complex.</p>

  <p>Dr Greer also has developed CE-5 (close encounters of the 5th kind)
protocols which he leads regular expeditions to successful contact.
Here, groups of people travel to remote locations to learn expanded
consciousness meditation techniques which consistently draw ET in a
variety of forms – from fully materialized craft to partially
materialized crafts and beings.</p>

  <p>In addition, Dr Greer is founder of the Orion Project, an organization
aiming to create a world of sustainability and enlightened abundance
through the funding of new energy systems.  The goal of the Orion
project is to provide a highly transparent multi disciplined research
center where scientists can work without fear of intimidation from the
current energy industry and government sectors (military industrial
complex) under the petrol dollar control.</p>

  <p>Special thanks to Matt Doyle for his photographic expertise and
assistance in capturing this first Contact work.</p>

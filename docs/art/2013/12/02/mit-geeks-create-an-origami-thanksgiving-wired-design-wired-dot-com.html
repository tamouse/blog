  <p>Lu says that though OrigaMIT probably tends to be slightly more
math-centric than your typical origami club, you don’t need to
possess A Beautiful Mind caliber math skills to join in. <em>Image:

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In theory, Origami is simple: Take a sheet of paper, follow the
dotted lines and without the use of scissors or glue, you’ve got a
paper crane. It stands to reason that if you’re good at following
instructions, you’re good at origami. And that’s true—anyone can
fold their way to a simple paper crane. But truly grasping the
geometric complexities of that crane? That’s actually pretty brainy
stuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Origami is arguably more math than art, so it makes sense then that
MIT would have a thriving origami scene. Every Sunday, a group of
around 20 to 30 people gather on campus to experiment with paper
folding techniques. Most recently, the group folded a series of
turkeys, cornucopias, pine cones and vegetables to create a
gorgeously nerdy Thanksgiving tableau.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re not a math person, it might seem incomprehensible to
fashion a turkey out of a single piece of paper, but for Yongquan Lu
and his fellow OrigaMIT members, it’s an entertaining challenge. Lu,
a sophomore mathematics major at MIT, is the incoming president of
of OrigaMIT, and has been practicing paper folding since high
school. “I really love how systematic origami is,” he says. “It’s
the perfect combination of math and art.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Much of origami is making use of repeating geometric
patterns. <em>Image: Dominick Reuter</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every origami model you see relies on a blueprint—a series of
pre-determined creases that will guide the folder through the
process. In the beginning, precise, careful folding can get you
pretty far, but if you want to start riffing on designs or creating
your own, you have to have more than an elementary grasp on some
basic mathematical principles. “I got more involved in investigating
the connections between math and geometry behind it,” he
says. “These days a lot of the stuff I fold is a lot more geometric,
more tessellations.” For the Thanksgiving scene, Lu contributed the
cornucopia basket, which he nonchalantly describes as a “pretty
well-known conical, flat tessellation pattern.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most of the students at MIT approach paper folding with a
highly-technical slant. It’s not uncommon for the group to have a
lengthy discussion about reverse-engineering each of the diagram’s
folds or talk about polyhedral shapes and hexagonal symmetry. “We’ll
ask ourselves, ‘Ok, where does this step come from, why does a
designer choose to do it like this? Or I wonder if I started with
these proportions, what would happen?” Lu explains. “That really
comes out of the engineering background of a lot of our members.”</p>

  <p>Lu is quick to clarify that though OrigaMIT probably tends to be
slightly more math-centric than your typical origami club, you don’t
need to possess <em>A Beautiful Mind</em>-caliber math skills to join
in. Sure, the peacock-like turkey took more than three hours to
fold, but if you look around, there are tons of simple yet beautiful
contributions like the vegetables, leaves and pine cones. “We wanted
to show that there are models of varying complexities. Sometimes
people get intimidated because they think we’re folding all of these
complex models,” he says. “But actually everyone can get
involved—it’s not something that’s exclusive and insular in any
way.”</p>

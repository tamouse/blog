<h1>Today's Painting: Alaskan Aurora</h1>
Dec 30, 2013


</header>

<p>Yes, it was a quite week in the heights (Mendota Heights, that is). We
had no class last week, and there’s no class this week. (Painting
class, that is.) So, like, you know, you do, we got out the
paints. Here’s my rendition:</p>

<p><a href="/images/alaskan-aurora.jpg"><img src="/images/alaskan-aurora-800.jpg" alt="Alaskan Aurora" title="[painting] Alaskan Aurora" /></a></p>

<p><small><em>Watercolour on 10x7 Arches 140lb cold press.</em></small></p>

<p>This was rather fun. First thing I did was use latex masking fluid by
dipping it onto an old toothbrush and splattering it on the
paper. Then mountain went it first as a mix of perm. rose and aureolin
to get a nice orangish red.</p>

<p>Then I laid in some plain aureolin where the greenish aurora was
going, let it dry, and then glazed it with some cobalt blue and
aureolin mixed, and dropped in some phthalo green to brighten it more.</p>

<p>The darker sky from the upper left started with just plain french
ultramarine, thinning it a bit as I got further into the middle, and
then swithed over to cobalt blue, thinned out a bit. Back in the
middle darker blue with french ultramarine again, blending the whole
while.</p>

<p>In the upper right corner I deepened the blue with mixing phthalo blue
and perm. rose.</p>

<p>The shadows on the mountains are mostly french ultramarine in a glaze
over the orange-red.</p>

<p>Finally rubbed off the mask when everything was dry. The upper left
part was sort of smudged, so it turned into the Milky Way.</p>

<p>All-in-all, I’m happy with it. I’m sending this to the person whose
photo provided the inspiration.</p>

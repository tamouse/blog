  <p>New Update! And thanks to the folks who featured my work!<br />
UPDATE! NEW FILE!</p>

  <p>Newly featured: <br />
Wall-E (Axiom, Zephyrus and Epiglottus city ships, based on the size calculation here: <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://buy-n-large.livejournal.com/179668.html">buy-n-large.livejournal.com/17…</a> )<br />
Dead Space (sizes mostly based on Dead Space Wikia and conjecture)<br />
Star Citizen (Size based on the Star Citizen Wiki)<br />
Galaxy Quest (Sizes taken from a Chart compiled by Dan Carlson, who inspired me for this chart)<br />
Space: Above and Beyond (Sizes taken from a Chart compiled by Dan Carlson, who inspired me for this chart)<br />
BattleTech (several Inner Sphere and Clan ships; based on www.sarna.net )<br />
Wing Commander (Sizes mostly via wcnews.com )<br />
StarCraft (Sizes and ship images taken from: <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://i2.minus.com/idKJOHIciRf0E.jpg">i2.minus.com/idKJOHIciRf0E.jpg</a> )<br />
Homeworld (based on conjecture, the Homeworld wiki which has everything except sizes, and a few fanmade charts)<br />
Close Encounter (image via Smithonian; size conjecture based on film clips)<br />
District 9 (Image internet; size wikipedia)</p>

  <p>Added to existing listings: <br />
Romulan Mining Ship, USS Odyssey, and USS Vengeance (Dreadnaught-class) for Star Trek</p>

  <p>I realise this is again no Mass Effect. I am having serious trouble finding both usable art (side views, as untilted as possible - some compromise is doable, but not too much that the shape of the ship ends up distorted). If anyone has either an artbook or images that work, PLEASE let me knoe (via note, since comments have gotten a tad overwhelming). Same with the Hitchhiker’s - anyone got something solid on the Heart of Gold and the Vogon ship?</p>

  <p>Also, by popular demand: the Tardis is already on the image. Whether it’s on the Red Dwarf and .25 pixels large or ALL ofthe image is your choice, it’s probably both, anyway. <img src="http://e.deviantart.net/emoticons/w/wink.gif" alt=";)" title=";) (Wink)" /></p>

  <p>Anyway, this is not the final update. Dune still needs to be done, a couple other stuff, and maybe I can finally find some useful Mass Effect stuff. It IS sorely missing. I am very aware of that!</p>

  <p>For the sake of usability, I am experimenting with coloured backgrounds (muted, not to take away from the ships) for easier finding of the ship you are loking for.</p>

  <p>===============</p>

  <p>This is a sorely needed update to my size comparison tables. For 40K, I now used the updated Rogue Trader sizes where applicable, resulting in much larger 40K vessels. Also, no battleships are present because there simply is no canonic size available on them. I kept <a href="http://andrea1969.deviantart.com/">andrea1969.deviantart.com/</a> s Eternal Crusader in (at 10 km length, because I figure it is close enough to the Vengeful Spirit, which has a given size), and the Malleus Syndicate’s (<a href="http://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://www.malleus.dk/Ordo/Default.aspx">www.malleus.dk/Ordo/Default.as…</a>) fantastic civilian ships because I just like them. Most ships, though, are Rogue Trader vessels. And yes, it’s still mostly Imperium. Ork ships, Eldar Ships and the likes may be added in the future though.</p>

  <p>Edit 4: The next Update! The chart now features the following series, universes and tabletop games: <br />
Star Wars (Expanded universe, G-Canon whereever possible)<br />
Star Trek (official stats)<br />
Stargate (official stats)<br />
EVE Online<br />
Warhammer 40.000<br />
Babylon 5<br />
Robotech/Macross <br />
Halo<br />
Battlestar Galactica (both series)<br />
Firefly/Serenity<br />
Farscape<br />
Titan A.E.<br />
Legend of Galactic Heroes<br />
Starship Troopers (TV and Movie)<br />
Aliens vs. Predator universe<br />
Lexx - The Dark Zone<br />
Red Dwarf<br />
Event Horizon<br />
V<br />
The Irresponsible Captain Tyler<br />
Martial Successor Nadesico<br />
Space Pirate Captain Haarlock<br />
Silent Running<br />
Independence Day</p>

  <p>Slated for the next update: District 9, Battletech universe, maybe more Macross, more classic sci-fi movies. Recommendations welcome!</p>

  <p>Edit 3: Yeah, so that last edit: I lied. Here’s a new chart.</p>

  <p>This chart now covers: Warhammer 40.000, Star Trek, Star Wars, Farscape, Battlestar Galactica, Starship Troopers, V, Halo, EVE online, Titan A.E. and Robotech. It’S … a lot of starships, to scale as best as I could find out the relevant scales. I used various online sources - specific wiki, other size comparison charts (especially Jeff Russell’s and Dan carlson’s), and other fanmade sites. Sometimes there were conflicting measurements, and I had to make a choice (I usually picked the larger one). Star Wars fans: I go with G-Canon, if in doubt. Yes, I liked Westwood games too. It’s not canon anymore. There’s worse things.</p>

  <p>Edit 2: This is the last edit on this, I promise. It’s a massive update though, including more ships from Star Wars, as I finally found decent images of a Souvereign! New stuff includes a few extra ridiculous ones (eh, torpedo egg?), more superdestroyers, some wacky superweapons, and a TON of all-new ships from Battlestar Galactica, EVE online, Halo and Stargate.</p>

  <p>Edit: Added Chaos warships. Overlooked these before in Battlefleet Koronus. And Eldar, Ork, Rak’Gol and Kroot. More to come, maybe, if new supplements add new ships.</p>

  <p>Full view is massively advised. A download of the image in full size is also possible.</p>

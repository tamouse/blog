  <p>Inside London’s Ronchini Gallery, miniature, lifelike worlds are
scattered about the white-walled rooms. Houses, people and landscapes
all looking like they could have been ripped from the pages of <em>Alice in
Wonderland</em> after the heroine sips her shrinking potion. The tiny works
of art are part of <a href="http://www.ronchinigallery.com/archives/mostre/dream-no-small-dreams-the-miniature-worlds-of-adrien-broom-thomas-doyle-and-patrick-jacobs"><em>Dream No Small Dreams</em></a>,
a newly opened exhibition curated by Bartholomew F. Bland that features
pieces from Patrick Jacobs, Thomas Doyle and Adrien Broom, three New
York City-based artists who are known for aiming a microscopic lens on
humanity.</p>

  <p>Each artist works in his or her preferred
medium—<a href="http://www.patrickjacobs.info/">Jacobs</a> in diorama,
<a href="http://www.thomasdoyle.net/">Doyle</a> in sculpture and
<a href="http://www.adrienbroom.com/#mi=1&amp;pt=0&amp;pi=1&amp;p=-1&amp;a=0&amp;at=0">Broom</a> in
photography—but all are united by their ability to craft intricately
detailed scenes in small scale. “When you work small, you can suggest
very big things,” explains Jacobs. “Utilized in the right way, the
tension created in that contradiction gives it meaning.” With their
doll-sized features you could almost call the works cute, if only the
scenes themselves weren’t so eerie. That contrast is most evident in
Doyle’s work, with its sculpted American-dream houses that appear
comforting until you realize they’re on the brink of toppling into a
sinkhole or have been torn apart in the back. Enclosed inside glass
domes, the mixed media pieces are meant to explore the ideas of fear,
anxiety, isolation and the dashing of best intentions.”The smaller scale
works well with these ideas, as you have to get close to the works to
engage with them,” he explains. “Doing so forges a curious bond – you
are hovering above them, far more powerful, yet when you see things at
their level you can connect intimately with the situations the people in
the works are enduring.”</p>

  <p><img src="http://www.wired.com/design/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/waltz.jpg" alt="" title="waltz" /></p>

  <p>Adrien Broom, <em>Waltz</em>. Broom builds the miniature sets found in her
<em>Frames of Mind</em> series in her studio and then photographs them to
capture the narrative.<em>Image: the artist and Ronchini Gallery</em></p>

  <p>Similarly, Broom’s photography feels as though you’re peeking inside the
surreal dreams of a spooky doll.  The photographer, who is best known
for her beautifully bizarre life-size sets, constructs the mini-sets in
her studio, using dirt, mirrors, malleable material or whatever she
happens to have around. “In ‘Untitled’ I knew I wanted to play with
shapes of smoke and have that become a character in itself,” she
explains. “I had a smoke machine set up below a small set I built, with
a hole in the base for light and smoke to rise from.” The resulting
images are gorgeous, if full of anxiety and isolation.</p>

  <p>Jacobs’ work is perhaps the most inviting of the exhibition, both in
mood and in the way it forces viewers to fully engage by peering into a
wall-installed dioramas. The artist builds each photo-realistic piece
while looking through a slightly concave lens. Using fine tweezers,
Jacobs arranges his materials—cat hair, aluminum foil, scraps of paper
and plastic— and uses effects like foreshortening, forced perspective
and LED lighting, to bring each diorama to life. Once installed in
walls, the works are like little windows to a fascinating alternate
reality. “I’m looking to engage the viewer directly on a kind of
journey,” says Jacobs. “If I can hold your attention for even a short
time, suspend disbelief and make you question where it is we’re going, I
think I’ve succeeded.”</p>

  <p>The show will be at the <a href="http://www.ronchinigallery.com/">Ronchini
Gallery</a> until October 6.</p>

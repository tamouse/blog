<blockquote>
  <p>In the rush to get to the main attraction–the 17-foot Renaissance
masterpiece David–many visitors to the Accademia in Florence walk
right by the gallery’s other Michelangelos. Lining the walls there
are four of the artist’s so-called
“<a href="http://ahuskofmeaning.com/2011/08/michelangelo-at-the-accademia-part-2-the-unfinished-slaves/">slave sculptures</a>,”
works intended for the tomb of Pope Julius II that the artist never
quite got around to finishing. In these, bodies emerge half-formed
from rough blocks of marble–a Renaissance master’s process frozen in
time. Peter Marigold had these in mind when he was making his
“<a href="http://www.petermarigold.com/Roughed%20Out%20Soldiers.htm">Roughed Out Soldiers</a>,”
and they offer the same sense of raw material being chipped away
into a familiar form. But there’s one big difference: With his
soldiers, Marigold’s totally faking it.</p>

  <p>What you’re seeing, in a sense, is a sculpture in reverse.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>At first glance, it looks like these pictures capture the creation
of a standard toy soldier, showing his journey from a
brightly-colored chunk of plastic to a miniature serviceman step by
step. After a second or two, though, you’ll catch yourself: Wait,
they don’t sculpt those things, do they? And you’ll be right–they
don’t. It’s a bit of a trick. Marigold started with the soldiers
and, mold by mold, turned them into something totally
unrecognizable.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The plastic pieces were created for <em>Blanks in Between</em>, an
exhibition by the
<a href="http://www.workshopforpotentialdesign.com/">Workshop for Potential Design</a>. On
his site, Marigold explains the process: “A rubber mould was made of
a toy soldier. The mould is then excavated and recast in
plastic. The excavation continues and each subsequent layer is cast
again and again in sequence until the humanoid form is reduced to an
amorphous blob.” What you’re seeing, in a sense, is a sculpture in
reverse. Or, as Marigold puts it, a record of the soldiers “being
consumed by the mould they were born from.”</p>

  <p>Something to remember: Every toy soldier is a mold or two away from
looking like a freaky geode wizard. <em>Photo: Peter Marigold</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lining the pieces up the way he did, from left to right, with the
rough forms evolving into the familiar ones in a sort of plastic
March of Progress, was done with the intention of generating a bit
of dissonance for the viewer. It’s an effort to play with our
expectations of a mass produced product. “I’ve actually left many
things ambiguous in the project,” he explains. “At a glance it might
seem to someone that the blobs are transforming into the more
familiar soldiers, but it’s the other way round.” The colors, too,
were picked for dissonance–the more accurate casts got the least
pigment, and thus the least mass-produced look, while the amorphous
blobs, which were in fact the most handmade, got bright, synthetic,
assembly-line hues.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The re-molded objects are fascinating on their own–it’s like those
recognizable humanoid forms are gradually calcified with geode-like
growth. But even in trying to introduce some procedural randomness
to these icons of the injection-molded era, Marigold got just the
results he was looking for. “The pieces are very chaotic, but I must
admit, they look exactly as I had imagined from the moment I started
the project.”</p>

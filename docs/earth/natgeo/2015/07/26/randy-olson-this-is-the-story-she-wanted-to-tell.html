<blockquote>
  <p>photo by @randyolson | words by @neilshea13 — This is the story she
wanted to tell. Feather, paint, and one shining eye, smudges on her
cheeks made with a fingertip. She came into the center of the
village and presented herself to the camera. Many others had the
ingredients but only she made this. She sat calmly for the portrait
and spoke only her name, which is now lost. In the years since, we
have wondered about the meaning of this photograph. There is a
temptation to pile a lot in, for much has changed on the Omo and
there are at least two girls here. One you see. To find the other
you must unmake the image. Ask her to remove the feather. Then the
paint. Then go back to before we arrived, before the boys tugged on
third-hand Playboy t-shirts and the girls, when they heard us
coming, slipped in lip plates and smeared clay onto their faces. Go
back before breakfast and dawn and roosters. Keep going. Return
upriver to camp. Return overland to the capital. Bury the roads on
your way, dismantle the plantations. Fire all the policemen and
gather up their guns. Shut down the Coca-Cola plant. Drive out
missionaries. Unbuild the dam that turns water into a question, and
level the government villages where no one wants to live. Keep going
until things look right. Keep leaving. At the first hotel, many
miles north, the clerk will greet you with a smile. “You are covered
with dust,” he’ll say. “Sometimes that is life.” Yes, sometimes. And
somewhere back behind you is the second girl, the one who appears on
most days, when life holds few reasons for paint or feathers. She is
tending goats, or looking at the moon. Possibly she is quite happy.</p>

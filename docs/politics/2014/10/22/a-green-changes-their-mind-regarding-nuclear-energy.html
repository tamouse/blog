<h1>A Green changes their mind regarding nuclear energy</h1>
Oct 22, 2014


</header>

<p>This is not a new article, as it appeared in The Guardian back in 2011. It is still a timely topic, however, and energy policies around the world in the ever increasing churn of climate change, economics, government policies, and so on, especially regarding nuclear power and it’s place in the mix, remains firmly entrenched in debate and soundbyte-ism, rather than any sort of progress. Polemics and demagoguery still rule the roost, but the commentary here at least acknowledges that nuclear is part of the mix.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2 id="why-fukushima-made-me-stop-worrying-and-love-nuclear-power">Why Fukushima made me stop worrying and love nuclear power</h2>
  <p>— <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/georgemonbiot">George Monbiot</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Japan’s disaster would weigh more heavily if there were less harmful alternatives. Atomic power is part of the mix.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Monday 21 March 2011 15.43 EDT</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You will not be surprised to hear that the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/japan" title="Guardian: Japan">events in
Japan</a> have
changed my view of nuclear power. You will be surprised to hear how they
have changed it. As a result of the disaster at Fukushima, I am no
longer nuclear-neutral. I now support the technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A crappy old plant with inadequate safety features was hit by a monster
earthquake and a vast tsunami. The electricity supply failed, knocking
out the cooling system. The reactors began to explode and melt down. The
disaster exposed a familiar legacy of poor design and corner-cutting.
Yet, as far as we know, no one has yet received a lethal dose of
radiation.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some greens have wildly exaggerated the dangers of radioactive
pollution. For a clearer view, look at the graphic published by
<a href="http://blog.xkcd.com/2011/03/19/radiation-chart/" title="xkcd.com">xkcd.com</a>.
It shows that the average total dose from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident" title="Wikipedia: Three Mile Island">Three Mile
Island</a>
disaster for someone living within 10 miles of the plant was one 625th
of the maximum yearly amount permitted for US radiation workers. This,
in turn, is half of the lowest one-year dose clearly linked to an
increased cancer risk, which, in its turn, is one 80th of an invariably
fatal exposure. I’m not proposing complacency here. I am proposing
perspective.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If other forms of energy production caused no damage, these impacts
would weigh more heavily. But energy is like medicine: if there are no
side-effects, the chances are that it doesn’t work.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like most greens, I favour a major expansion of renewables. I can also
sympathise with the complaints of their opponents. It’s not just the
onshore windfarms that bother people, but also the new grid connections
(pylons and power lines). As the proportion of renewable electricity on
the grid rises, more pumped storage will be needed to keep the lights
on. That means reservoirs on mountains: they aren’t popular, either.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The impacts and costs of renewables rise with the proportion of power
they supply, as the need for storage and redundancy increases. It may
well be the case (I have yet to see a comparative study) that up to a
certain grid penetration – 50% or 70%, perhaps? – renewables have
smaller carbon impacts than nuclear, while beyond that point, nuclear
has smaller impacts than renewables.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like others, I have called for renewable power to be used both to
replace the electricity produced by fossil fuel and to expand the total
supply, displacing the oil used for transport and the gas used for
heating fuel. Are we also to demand that it replaces current nuclear
capacity? The more work we expect renewables to do, the greater the
impact on the landscape will be, and the tougher the task of public
persuasion.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But expanding the grid to connect people and industry to rich, distant
sources of ambient energy is also rejected by most of the greens who
complained about the blog post I wrote last week in which I argued that
nuclear remains safer than coal. What they want, they tell me, is
something quite different: we should power down and produce our energy
locally. Some have even called for the abandonment of the grid. Their
bucolic vision sounds lovely, until you read the small print.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>At high latitudes like ours, most small-scale ambient power production
is a dead loss. Generating solar power in the UK involves a spectacular
waste of scarce resources. It’s hopelessly inefficient and poorly
matched to the pattern of demand. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/windpower">Wind
power</a> in populated
areas is largely worthless. This is partly because we have built our
settlements in sheltered places; partly because turbulence caused by the
buildings interferes with the airflow and chews up the mechanism.
Micro-hydropower might work for a farmhouse in Wales, but it’s not much
use in Birmingham.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And how do we drive our textile mills, brick kilns, blast furnaces and
electric railways – not to mention advanced industrial processes?
Rooftop solar panels? The moment you consider the demands of the whole
economy is the moment at which you fall out of love with local energy
production. A national (or, better still, international) grid is the
essential prerequisite for a largely renewable energy supply.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some greens go even further: why waste renewable resources by turning
them into electricity? Why not use them to provide energy directly? To
answer this question, look at what happened in Britain before the
industrial revolution.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The damming and weiring of British rivers for watermills was
small-scale, renewable, picturesque and devastating. By blocking the
rivers and silting up the spawning beds, they helped bring to an end the
gigantic runs of migratory fish that were once among our great natural
spectacles and which fed much of Britain – wiping out
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon" title="Wikipedia: Sturgeon">sturgeon</a>,
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Cephalaspidomorphi" title="BBC: Lampreys">lampreys</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shad" title="Wikipedia: Shad">shad</a>, as well
as most sea trout and salmon.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Traction was intimately linked with starvation. The more land that was
set aside for feeding draft animals for industry and transport, the less
was available for feeding humans. It was the 17th-century equivalent of
today’s biofuels crisis. The same applied to heating fuel. As EA Wrigley
points out in his book <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521131858" title="Cambridge University Press: Energy and the English Industrial Revolution">Energy and the English Industrial Revolution</a>,
the 11m tonnes of coal mined in England in 1800 produced as much energy
as 11m acres of woodland (one third of the land surface) would have
generated.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before coal became widely available, wood was used not just for heating
homes but also for industrial processes: if half the land surface of
Britain had been covered with woodland, Wrigley shows, we could have
made 1.25m tonnes of bar iron a year (a fraction of current consumption)
and nothing else. Even with a much lower population than today’s,
manufactured goods in the land-based economy were the preserve of the
elite. Deep green energy production – decentralised, based on the
products of the land – is far more damaging to humanity than nuclear
meltdown.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the energy source to which most economies will revert if they shut
down their nuclear plants is not wood, water, wind or sun, but fossil
fuel. On every measure (climate change, mining impact, local pollution,
industrial injury and death, even radioactive discharges) coal is 100
times worse than nuclear power. Thanks to the expansion of shale gas
production, the impacts of natural gas are catching up fast.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, I still loathe the liars who run the nuclear industry. Yes, I would
prefer to see the entire sector shut down, if there were harmless
alternatives. But there are no ideal solutions. Every energy technology
carries a cost; so does the absence of energy technologies. Atomic
energy has just been subjected to one of the harshest of possible tests,
and the impact on people and the planet has been small. The crisis at
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/fukushima">Fukushima</a> has
converted me to the cause of nuclear power.</p>

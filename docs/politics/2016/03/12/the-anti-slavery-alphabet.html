<h1>The Anti-Slavery Alphabet</h1>
Mar 12, 2016


</header>

<p>An interesting old book surfaced to my attention, a little late for
Black History Month this year, but still quite relevant: “The
Anti-Slavery Alphabet”. Written in 1846 for the Anti-Slavery Faire in
Philidelphia of that year, it’s a basic primer for teaching letters
with anti-slavery lessons.</p>

<p>The forward, here:</p>

<p><img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/tt.imageshare/blog/politics/2016-03-12-the-anti-slavery-alphabet/anti-slavery-alphabet-1846-03.jpg" alt="forward" /></p>

<p>reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2 id="to-our-little-readers">To our little readers.</h2>
</blockquote>

<blockquote style="white-space: pre-line">
  <p>Listen, little children, all,
Listen to our earnest call:
You are very young, ‘tis true,
But there’s much that you can do.
Even you can plead with men
That they buy not slaves again,
And that those they have may be
Quickly set at liberty.</p>

  <p>They may harken what <em>you</em> say,
Though from <em>us</em> they turn away.
Sometimes, when from school you walk,
You can with your playmates talk,
Tell them of the slave child’s fate,
Motherless and desolate.</p>

  <p>And you can refuse to take
Candy, sweetmeat, pie or cake,
Saying “no” – unless ‘tis free –
“The slave shall not work for me.”</p>

  <p>Thus, dear little children, each
May some useful lesson teach;
Thus each one may help to free
This fair land from slavery.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="a-is-an-abolitionist--b-is-a-brother">“A is an Abolitionist / B is a Brother”</h2>

<p><img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/tt.imageshare/blog/politics/2016-03-12-the-anti-slavery-alphabet/anti-slavery-alphabet-1846-04.jpg" alt="A B" /></p>

<blockquote style="white-space: pre-line">
  <p>A is an Abolitionist –
A man who want to free
The wretched slave – and give to all
An equal liberty</p>

  <p>B is a Brother with a skin
Of somewhat darker hue,
But of our Heavenly Father’s sight,
He is as dear as you</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="k-is-the-kidnapper--l-is-the-lash">“K is the Kidnapper / L is the Lash”</h2>

<p><img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/tt.imageshare/blog/politics/2016-03-12-the-anti-slavery-alphabet/anti-slavery-alphabet-1846-09.jpg" alt="K L" /></p>

<blockquote style="white-space: pre-line">
  <p>K is the Kidnapper, who stole
That little child and mother –
Shrieking, it clung around her, but
He tore them from each other.</p>

  <p>L is the Lash, that brutally
He swung around its head
Threatening that “if it cried again,
He’d whip it till ‘twas dead.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Problematic use of “its” in the second line of the “L” stanza I <em>believe</em>
is intentionally showing the de-humanization of slaves, but I don’t
think they should have there – the need at this point is for
<em>re-humanizing</em> the person being tortured.</p>

<h2 id="m-is-the-merchant-of-the-north--n-is-the-negro-rambling-free">M is the Merchant of the North / N is the Negro, Rambling Free</h2>

<p><img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/tt.imageshare/blog/politics/2016-03-12-the-anti-slavery-alphabet/anti-slavery-alphabet-1846-10.jpg" alt="M N" /></p>

<blockquote style="white-space: pre-line">
  <p>M is the Merchant of the north,
Who buys what slaves produce –
So they are stolen, whipped, and worked,
For his, <strong>AND FOR OUR USE</strong></p>

  <p>N is the Negro, rambling free
In his far distant home,
Delighting ‘neath the palm trees’ shade
And cocoa-nut to roam</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emphasis mine, <strong>for we have been complicit.</strong></p>

<p>Romanticism in the flesh here, about African natives lives and
environment; perhaps as bad as anything else. Perhaps the sentiment
is what’s important? Perhaps not.</p>

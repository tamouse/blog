<blockquote>
  <p>The cry of Black power is a reaction to the reluctance of White power to make the kinds of changes necessary to make justice a reality for the American Negro.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A riot is the language of the unheard.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And what is it America has failed to hear?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It has failed to hear that the economic plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Wallace] <em>How many summers like this do you think we can expect?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will tell you now, the mood of the Negro community is one of urgency, one of saying we aren’t gonna wait, that we’ve gotta have our freedom, we’ve waited too long. So that I would say that every Summer we are going to have this kind of vigorous protest. …</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The answer to how long it will take will depend on the Federal Government, on the City Halls of our various cities, and on White America to a large extent. This is where we are at this point, and I think White America will determine how long it will be and which way we’ll go in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Wallace] <em>… Why has the Negro found it so difficult to make his way up out of the ghetto?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>No other American group has been a slave on American soil.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another thing is the American Negro has high visibility, and because of the prejudices existing in the country, his color has been against him. It’s been against him and they’ve used this to keep him from moving up. In the final analysis, when you say to a man that you are in this position because of your race or because of your color, you say to that man that he can never get out of it. Other racial groups have been able to change their accent or change their names, but the Negro can’t.</p>

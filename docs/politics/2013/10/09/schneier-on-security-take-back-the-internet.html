<h1>Schneier on Security: Take Back the Internet</h1>
Oct 9, 2013


</header>

<p>Steven Schneier makes a call to arms for the people who build and
maintain the Internet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>September 15, 2013</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <h2 id="take-back-the-internet">Take Back the Internet</h2>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Government and industry have betrayed the
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet">Internet</a>, and us.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>By subverting the Internet at every level to make it a vast,
multi-layered and robust surveillance platform, the NSA has
undermined a fundamental social contract. The companies that build
and manage our Internet infrastructure, the companies that create
and sell us our hardware and software, or the companies that host
our data: we can no longer trust them to be ethical Internet
stewards.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is not the Internet the world needs, or the Internet its
creators envisioned. We need to take it back.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And by we, I mean the engineering community.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, this is primarily a political problem, a policy matter that
requires political intervention.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But this is also an engineering problem, and there are several
things engineers can – and should – do.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>One, we should expose. If you do not have a security clearance, and
if you have not received a National Security Letter, you are not
bound by a federal confidentially requirements or a gag order. If
you have been contacted by the NSA to subvert a product or protocol,
you need to come forward with your story. Your employer obligations
don’t cover illegal or unethical activity. If you work with
classified data and are truly brave, expose what you
know. <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essay-429.html">We need whistleblowers</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We need to know how exactly how the NSA and other agencies are
subverting routers, switches, the Internet backbone, encryption
technologies and cloud systems. I already have five stories from
people like you, and I’ve just started collecting. I
want 50. There’s safety in numbers, and this form of civil
disobedience is the moral thing to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two, we can design. We need to figure out how to re-engineer the
Internet to prevent this kind of wholesale spying. We need new
techniques to prevent communications intermediaries from leaking
private information.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can make surveillance expensive again. In particular, we need
open protocols, open implementations, open systems – these will be
harder for the NSA to subvert.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Internet Engineering Task Force, the group that defines the
standards that make the internet run, has a meeting planned for
early November in Vancouver. This group needs to dedicate its next
meeting to this task. This is an emergency, and demands an emergency
response.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Three, we can influence governance. I have resisted saying this up
to now, and I am saddened to say it, but the US has proved to be an
unethical steward of the Internet. The UK is no better. The NSA’s
actions are legitimizing the internet abuses by China, Russia, Iran
and others. We need to figure out new means of internet governance,
ones that makes it harder for powerful tech countries to monitor
everything. For example, we need to demand
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/essay-435.html">transparency, oversight, and accountability</a>
from our governments and corporations.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunately, this is going play directly into the hands of
totalitarian governments that want to control their country’s
Internet for even more extreme forms of surveillance. We need to
figure out how to prevent that, too. We need to avoid the mistakes
of the International Telecommunications Union, which has become a
forum to legitimize bad government behavior, and create truly
international governance that can’t be dominated or abused by any
one country.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generations from now, when people look back on these early decades
of the Internet, I hope they will not be disappointed in us. We can
ensure that they don’t only if each of us makes this a priority, and
engages in the debate. We have a
<a href="http://wikileaks.org/Statement-by-Edward-Snowden-to.html">moral duty</a>
to do this, and we have no time to lose.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dismantling the surveillance state won’t be easy. Has any country
that engaged in mass surveillance of its own citizens voluntarily
given up that capability? Has any mass surveillance country avoided
becoming totalitarian? Whatever happens, we’re going to be breaking
new ground.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Again, the politics of this is a bigger task than the engineering,
but the engineering is critical. We need to demand that real
technologists be involved in any key government decision making on
these issues. We’ve had enough of lawyers and politicians not fully
understanding technology; we need technologists at the table when we
build tech policy.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>To the engineers, I say this: we built the Internet, and some of us
have helped to subvert it. Now, those of us who love liberty have to
fix it.</p>

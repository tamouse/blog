  <p>Thu, 2013-09-05 06:00</p>

  <p>In the company of lesbians of my generation and older, I frequently hear
conversation about how much things have changed since we were young. And
invariably, someone asks: Where have all the butches gone?</p>

  <p>The question is driven in part by nostalgia, and in part by discomfort
with what seems to have been a shift in the way young lesbians think
about gender.</p>

  <p>And the first question often leads to others: Why are all the butches
becoming men? Why can’t they understand that gender is a social
construct, and that women don’t have to conform to a feminine ideal?
Isn’t that what we were fighting for – a world in which women could wear
tool belts and neckties and do anything we damn well please, without the
constraints of gender?</p>

  <p>At its very core, this was the vision of the feminist movement, and
lesbians more than anyone understood how transformative this could be.</p>

  <p>Years ago, I asked the same questions, but today, this conversation
makes me uncomfortable. Because I am of this older generation, I have
seen things change – and not change – for a long time.</p>

  <p>I have, in my life, loved many butches. My relationships and affairs
have almost always been with masculine women and, more recently, with
trans men as well.</p>

  <p>In my experience, for as long as I have found myself in intimate
circumstances with butches/studs/masculine-identified women – from way
back when I was too young to be in the bars where I was meeting and
going home with them – a curious thing happens. Once there is enough
trust established, I become witness to a moment of confession. The
confession goes something like this: “I don’t know how to explain this,
but I don’t exactly feel like a woman. I mean, I’m butch, and that’s
close, but honestly, I’m not sure what I am.”</p>

  <p>Don’t get me wrong, there are many, many proud butch women who are
exactly that: women. In today’s terminology, their gender expression is
masculine, and their gender identity is female. They wear their tool
belts proudly, and I am happy to admire the show. For them, a butch
identity resolves the issue – if people have a problem with it, it’s
their sexism or homophobia rearing its head.</p>

  <p>But that experience is not everyone’s, and it never has been. Butches
may look a lot alike on the outside, but they aren’t the same on the
inside.</p>

  <p>In the mid 1990s, as a grad student, I wrote about the lesbian history
of Detroit. I interviewed 48 women who had lived as lesbians between
1930 and 1970. When I met them, these women were mostly in their sixties
and seventies. Of the 48, four –  almost 10% – said that if they were
young today, they would transition their gender and become men.</p>

  <p>This didn’t surprise me, really, because of all those late-night
confessions I’d already heard. I knew that for many, “butch” was the
closest they could come to a word that would describe the experience of
being a masculine person in a woman’s body. But for these folks, while
“butch” was better than “woman” or “lesbian,” it still fell short.
You’ve probably heard butches who say that they don’t use the term
“butch lesbian,” but prefer simply “butch.” This isn’t a denial of
sexual orientation, but a claiming of a complicated gender identity.</p>

  <p>One of the mistakes that we made as lesbian feminists is that we
combined sexual orientation and gender expression into an androgynous
dyke ideal: short hair, no makeup, able to fix a car or bake bread with
equal ease, frequently accused of being in the wrong public restroom
(much to our outrage).</p>

  <p>How did you know you were a lesbian? You got thrown out of Girl Scouts
and hated Barbie, and never felt comfortable in a dress and heels. But
as well-intentioned as we may have been, plenty of lesbians never fit
that ideal. Not just trans men but also lesbians like me, who pored over
<em>Glamour</em> magazine and loved anything that sparkled. The orientation
fit, but my attempts at correct dyke behavior were a miserable failure.</p>

  <p>In short, the gender of who we love has always been a separate question
from our own gender expression, and our attempt to consolidate gender
identity and expression with sexual orientation has led us to a
fundamental misunderstanding of the trans experience.</p>

  <p>When lesbians ask where the butches have gone, what we’re saying is that
we don’t understand trans men. We are stuck on three core beliefs:</p>

  <p>For many of us, particularly of an older generation, being out and proud
lesbians and feminists has been our life’s journey – and hard won. The
communities that we’ve built as a shelter from the storm of a misogynist
culture are particularly dear. As one close friend said to me, “I love
being a woman so much that I can’t imagine giving that up.” And the idea
of becoming a man – with all the unearned, unexamined privilege that the
idea suggests – is especially incomprehensible; it’s a betrayal of
trust.</p>

  <p>Others believe that choosing to transition from being butch to being a
man shows a lack of courage or imagination, that somehow the person
wasn’t brave enough to be a butch woman.</p>

  <p>Still others think we’ve failed as a community to create a space in
which any woman can dress and act as she pleases. That was my first
reaction to those Detroit butches and studs: that the times were so hard
that it had made them long for escape. I wondered if, had they been born
a generation later, they might have found support in lesbian feminist
communities that they were lacking in the rough-and-tumble bar culture
that was their only refuge.</p>

  <p>But I have since learned that transition is not a betrayal, a lack of
courage, or a desire to escape a unwelcoming community. That’s what
these Detroit butches and studs taught me. They lived their lives with
enormous heart and against all odds.  They were the bravest people I
knew. They were the survivors, as street-smart and as proud as anyone
I’d met in lesbian feminist circles. I simply couldn’t believe they
didn’t have the guts or the vision to live fully as who they were.</p>

  <p>And so I came to a different understanding. I now believe that all of
the battles we fought and the work that we did has created a community
where women can be our true selves to a far greater degree, in every
aspect of our lives. And in doing that, we’ve made a space where it’s
okay to try out different forms of gender expression, from super-femme
to androgynous to butch. That has been incredibly freeing for most of
us.</p>

  <p>But for some, the hard-won space and freedom to try out different forms
of gender expression has confirmed what they knew deep down: that
fundamentally, they’re not women at all. And they know that because
they’ve had the space and the freedom to be butch, and it still wasn’t
the right fit.</p>

  <p>Most trans men I know came out as lesbians, then claimed a butch
identity, and then transitioned. Some of them have realized they never
were attracted to women at all and are now gay men – this isn’t as odd
as it might sound, if you accept that the lesbian community is the only
safe space to explore gender, so it’s where many trans men start their
journey.</p>

  <p>Maybe that’s why lesbians feel we’ve lost them: because we believed they
were ours.</p>

  <p>Transgender people are figuring out how to change what is arguably a
person’s deepest identity, the one we are most identified with from
birth. The challenges, both in terms of navigating one’s own changing
body and the outside world, are staggering, even in the most supportive
communities. To make such a decision is like jumping off a cliff with
little idea what lies below, but knowing that not to make the leap is
another type of agony. This courage deserves our respect and our
support.</p>

  <p>So where have all the butches gone? They’re still around, although some
of them go by other names. Some are still proud butches and studs;
others, particularly young people, prefer the term “genderqueer,” with
endless subcategories that underscore that gender identity and
expression may intersect with sexual orientation but aren’t subsumed by
it. They’ve come to understand that gender-variant people may fall
across a wide span of femininity and masculinity, but what they have in
common is the experience of falling outside of society’s expectations of
their gender.</p>

  <p>At the core of this experience is enormous creativity and an analysis of
gender as a social construct that got its start in lesbian feminism and
gay liberation. All our work isn’t forgotten; it has been built upon by
a new generation seeking to be true to themselves, just as we dreamed
they would.</p>

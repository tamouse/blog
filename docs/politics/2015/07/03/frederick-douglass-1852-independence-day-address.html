<h1>Frederick Douglass Address: 'The Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro'</h1>
Jul 3, 2015


</header>

<p>In 1852, Frederick Douglass, one of the most powerful voices for
the abolition of slavery was asked to give an address on the American
Independence day holiday.</p>

<p>Herewith, his words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fellow-citizens,
pardon me, allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here
to-day? What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national
independence? Are the great principles of political freedom and of
natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence,
extended to us? And am I, therefore, called upon to bring our humble
offering to the national altar, and to confess the benefits and
express devout gratitude for the blessings resulting from your
independence to us?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary! Your
high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between
us. The blessings in which you this day rejoice are not enjoyed in
common. The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity, and
independence bequeathed by your fathers is shared by you, not by
me. The sunlight that brought life and healing to you has brought
stripes and death to me. This Fourth of July is yours, not mine. You
may rejoice, I must mourn. To drag a man in fetters into the grand
illuminated temple of liberty, and call upon him to join you in
joyous anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony. Do you
mean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to speak today?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>What, to the American slave, is your Fourth of July? I answer: a day
that reveals to him, more than all other days of the year, the gross
injustice and cruelty to which he is a constant victim. To him, your
celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your
national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are
empty and heartless; your denunciation of tyrants, brass fronted
impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your
prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your
religious parade and solemnity, are, to Him, mere bombast, fraud,
deception, impiety, and hypocrisy—a thin veil to cover up crimes
that would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation of
the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the
people of these United States at this very hour.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>At a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is
needed. O! had I the ability, and could reach the nation’s ear, I
would, to-day, pour forth a stream, a fiery stream of biting
ridicule, blasting reproach, withering sarcasm, and stern
rebuke. For it is not light that is needed, but fire; it is not the
gentle shower, but thunder. We need the storm, the whirlwind, the
earthquake. The feeling of the nation must be quickened; the
conscience of the nation must be roused; the propriety of the nation
must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; and
the crimes against God and man must be proclaimed and denounced.</p>

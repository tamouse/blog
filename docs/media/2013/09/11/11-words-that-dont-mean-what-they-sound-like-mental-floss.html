<h1>11 Words That Don't Mean What They Sound Like | Mental Floss</h1>
Sep 11, 2013


</header>

<p>A great list of words that have some use, but probably incorrect. :)
Memorize these!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>February 11, 2013 - 10:11am</p>

  <p><strong>1. Bodkin</strong> must mean “little body.” Didn’t Hamlet say something about
a “bare bodkin”? He did. But he was talking about taking the “not to be”
option, ending his suffering with a bodkin, or dagger. (Origin unknown.)</p>

  <p><strong>2. Crapulous</strong> sounds cruddy. After all if Bart Simpson uses
craptastic to mean the opposite of fantastic, crapulous must be the
opposite of fabulous; right? Wrong. It means “characterized by gross
excess in drinking or eating” or “hung over.” (From Latin <em>crapula,</em>
“inebriation,” and Greek <em>kraipalē,</em> “drunken headache.”)</p>

  <p><strong>3. Crepuscular</strong> refers not to an oozing skin ailment but to twilight
or to creatures active at twilight, like bats, mosquitoes, and vampires.
(Mid 17th cent.: from Latin <em>crepusculum</em>, meaning “twilight.”)</p>

  <p><strong>4. Formication</strong> may sound sexy, but it means “an abnormal sensation
as of ants creeping over the skin.” (From Latin <em>formīcāre</em>, meaning “to
crawl like ants.”)</p>

  <p><strong>5. Funambulist</strong> sounds like it should be the driver of an ambulance
decorated with happy faces, but it’s actually a tightrope walker. (From
Latin <em>fūnambul-us</em>—fūn-is, “rope,” plus ambul-āre, “to walk’” plus the
-ist suffix, “designating a person who practices some art or method.”)</p>

  <p><strong>6. Fungible</strong> sounds like it describes a squishy, spongy fungus, but
it’s a legal term describing goods or money that can replace or be
replaced by equivalent items. (From medieval Latin <em>fungibilis; *from
*fungi,</em> meaning “perform, enjoy,” with the same sense as <em>fungi
vice,</em> “serve in place of.” It’s not related to fungus, which is related
to sponge.)</p>

  <p><strong>7. Noisome</strong> doesn’t mean noisy, but stinky or otherwise disagreeable
or offensive. (From the obsolete late Middle English word <em>noy</em>, a
shortened form of annoy, plus <em>-some</em>, an adjective-forming suffix.)</p>

  <p><strong>8. Nugatory</strong> sounds creamy and delicious but it means unimportant, of
no value or useless; futile. (From Latin <em>nugatorius;</em> from <em>nugari</em> “to
trifle”; from <em>nugae,</em> or “jests.”)</p>

  <p><strong>9. Pulchritude</strong> sounds like the ineptness exhibited by a lurching
klutz, but it’s a highfalutin word for “beauty.” (From Latin
*pulchritūdō, *“beauty” by way of Middle French.)</p>

  <p><strong>10. Plethora</strong> may sound like an ancient Greek musical instrument, but
it means an excess of something. When it entered English in the mid 16th
century, it was a medical term for an excess of a bodily fluid,
particularly blood. Although modern medicos have given up leech therapy,
plethora is still used to mean an excessive volume of blood. (Via late
Latin from Greek <em>plēthōrē, *and from *plēthein,</em> meaning “be full.”)</p>

  <p><strong>11. Callipygian</strong>sounds like a bird with a suntan and a laid-back
attitude, but it means “having shapely buttocks.” (From Greek
<em>kallipūgos</em>, which was used to describe a famous statue of Venus, and
from <em>kallos, *or “beauty,” and *pūgē,</em> or “buttocks,” plus -ian.)</p>

Dictionary (Second Ed.), The American Heritage Dictionary of the English
Language (Fifth ed.)</em></p>

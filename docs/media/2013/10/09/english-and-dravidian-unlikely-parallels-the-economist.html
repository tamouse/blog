<p>Comparing and constrasting two languages that mug other languages for

<blockquote>
  <p>IF FORCED to pick my favourite part of the history of English, I’d
be torn. There are so many to choose from. Would I pick the Great
Vowel Shift, the mid-millennium change in pronunciation that largely
explains English’s inconsistent spelling? Perhaps I’d turn to
colonial times, when English vocabulary ballooned. I do like Noah
Webster’s attempts to change American English spelling in the name
of efficiency, too.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But my favourite must be the Norman invasion of 1066. When the
Normans, who spoke a dialect of Old French, ruled over England, they
changed the face of English. Over the ensuing two centuries,
thousands of Old French words entered English. Because the ruling
class spoke Old French, that set of vocabulary became synonymous
with the elite. Everyone else used Old English. During this period,
England’s society was diglossic: one community, two language sets
with distinct social spheres. Today, English-speakers pick and
choose from the different word sets—Latinate (largely Old French
borrowings) and Germanic (mostly Old English-derived
words)—depending on the occasion. Although English is no longer in a
diglossic relationship with another language, the Norman-era
diglossia remains reflected in the way we choose and mix
vocabulary. In informal chat, for example, we might <em>go on</em> to <em>ask</em>
something, but in formal speech we’d <em>proceed</em> to <em>inquire</em>. There
are hundreds of such pairs: <em>match</em>/<em>correspond</em>, <em>mean</em>/<em>intend</em>,
<em>see</em>/<em>perceive</em>, <em>speak</em>/<em>converse</em>. Most of us choose one or the
other without even thinking about the history behind the
split. Germanic words are often described as earthier, simpler, and
friendlier. Latinate vocabulary, on the other hand, is lofty and
elite. It’s amazing that nine hundred years later, the social and
political structure of 12th-century England still affects how we
think about and use English.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>English isn’t alone in having this sort of split
personality. Halfway across the world, languages spoken in southern
India underwent similar changes. Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, and
Telugu, the four major languages spoken there, are Dravidian
languages. They are structurally unrelated to the languages of
northern India, which are Indo-European. But Sanskrit, an
Indo-European language of ancient India and the liturgical language
of Hinduism, has held prestige all over the subcontinent for over
two thousand years. Kannada, Telugu, and Malayalam—and to a lesser
extent Tamil—have absorbed, and continue to absorb, thousands of
Sanskrit words. (A
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Tamil">relatively recent movement</a>
among Tamil-speakers aimed to expunge the Sanskrit borrowings.) Much
of southern India, just like Norman England, was diglossic between
Sanskrit (used ritually and formally by Hindu elites) and vernacular
Dravidian languages. Today, that diglossia is gone, but
Sanskrit-derived vocabulary still forms an upper crust, mostly
pulled out for formal speech or writing.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some writing, especially poetry, still slants toward native
vocabulary. Two influential religious movements among Hindu
Kannada-speakers, the 12th-century Lingāyat and the 16th-century
Haridāsa movements, treasured simple Kannada poetry. These movements
arose in part to spread religious teachings beyond Sanskrit-educated
elites to the common people. Works written then are largely devoid
of obvious Sanskrit borrowings. To many Kannada-speakers, those
works are softer and folksier than stiffer Sanskrit-heavy works. But
caste and class politics didn’t end then, of course.  Sanskrit still
holds sway in India today, officially one of the “scheduled”
languages listed in the constitution. It sometimes seems like any
Kannada newscaster or speechwriter worth his salt swears by a
Sanskrit dictionary. Sanskrit borrowings are used all over the place
in order to sound proper, even when it sounds strange. (My favourite
example of strained usage is the upscaling of “toilet” to
<em>shauchālaya</em>, “abode of cleanliness”.) In the most tortured formal
writing, Sanskrit words might just be strung together with Kannada
grammatical endings. This has the strange consequence of allowing
speakers of unrelated languages like Hindi to take a stab at
translating the text. (Hindi, as it happens, is also split between
the Sanskrit-heavy *shuddh, *“pure”, Hindi, popular in government
and academia, and colloquial Hindi, which makes greater use of
Arabic and Persian borrowings.) There’s some sweet spot in the
middle of both extremes. Good writers seem to get it best.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It has always fascinated me how the Sanskrit/Dravidian divide in
Kannada is so strikingly similar to the Latinate/Germanic divide in
English. In English, word choice is often used to judge someone’s
class or education. In Kannada, caste is also mixed in. Picking
certain words over others can have social consequences, branding the
speaker or writer according to his vocabulary. In both languages,
older borrowings underwent sound and spelling changes, but newer
borrowings keep the roots intact. (In English, these old pre-Norman
borrowings are mainly religious terms, like “nun”, “monk”, or
“priest”.) “Native” terms are considered earthier and
Sanskrit/Latin-derived borrowings are stuffier. But there are
interesting differences, too. English didn’t descend from Latin,
though they’re both Indo-European. Dravidian languages, in contrast,
aren’t related to Sanskrit at all. In Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam,
the alphabet had to expand dramatically to incorporate Sanskrit
sounds like voicing and aspiration. The shift was so complete that
each language’s alphabet, while written completely distinctly,
contains nearly all of the same sounds as the Sanskrit-descended
Hindi.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many languages have “high” and “low” layers of vocabulary. But in
most other languages, the two sets are drawn from the same
source. By contrast, contact between Old English and French,
Dravidian languages and Sanskrit, Japanese and Chinese, Persian and
Arabic, and other pairings around the world have created
fascinatingly hybrid languages. These mixed lexicons are, for
linguistic and social historians, akin to the layers of fossils that
teach paleontologists and archaeologists so much about eras gone by.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some people even think English is descended from Latin, or Kannada
from Sanskrit. That’s frustrating not only because it’s wrong, but
also because the reality is far more interesting.</p>

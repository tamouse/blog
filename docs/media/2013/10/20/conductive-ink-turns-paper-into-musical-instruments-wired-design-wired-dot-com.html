<blockquote>
  <p>When we think of innovative ways to teach children we often defer to
screens. You hear schools boasting, “Every student gets an iPad!” or
extolling the virtues of a new computer coding program they’ve
implemented. And all that is great—it really is. Unfortunately, as
we increase our focus on technology, it usually means we decrease
the time children spend actually making with old fashioned tools
like paper, paint and scissors. But not always. A new project from
Italian startup MusicInk is combining technology and tactile art
making to create a new way to teach children the basics of music.</p>

  <p>A simple action provokes a surreal outcome.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://musicink.co/">MusicInk</a>, created by product designers Gilda
Negrini and Riccardo Vendramin and software engineer Luong Bui, is a
prototype kit that turns paper into functioning, noise-making
instruments through conductive paint and an Arduino. The kit comes
with a set of stencils that children use to paint various
instruments onto a piece of paper using the carbon paint from Bare
Conductive, the same paint that was used in Calvin Harris’ human
instrument video for “Humanthesizer.” There’s a guitar with strings,
a trumpet, drum, and piano key. After adding a couple of coats, each
painting is connected to an Arduino Duemilanove board with a
Sparkfun MPR121via electrodes and cables.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The brains of the Arduino is synced up with a smartphone app via
Bluetooth, essentially turning the paper instruments into capacitive
sensors that react to gestures. So every time a child taps a drum,
pushes down on a trumpet’s valve or strums a guitar, a musical
sound, all recorded by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, is
emitted. The controller box holds up to 12 electrodes, so a group of
children can be playing instruments simultaneously, like a
paper-made orchestra. “Children’s reactions are extraordinary,” say
the designers. “It’s beautiful to see their amazed face when they
realize they can play a simple piece of paper.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is a little bit magical to watch as a piece of paper transforms
into an interactive instrument. And upon first seeing the
instruments in action, it feels almost as though you’re in a cartoon
where a simple action provokes a surreal outcome. The gestures are
simple enough for children to understand, and the designers plan on
making the kit even more intuitive, customizable and possibly
wireless, before they make it available to purchase. Their hope,
they say, is to create a low-cost, customizable product that will
challenge children to think about music in a new way. “We think that
giving a different and more tangible way to learn something
theoretical, like the basics of music, might be very interesting
both for children and teachers,” they say. “We, as designers, think
that learning is easier when made with something practical.”</p>

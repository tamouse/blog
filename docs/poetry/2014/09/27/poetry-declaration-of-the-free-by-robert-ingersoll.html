<h1>Poetry: Declaration of the Free, by Robert Ingersoll</h1>
Sep 27, 2014


</header>

<p>A poem found that speaks volumes in today’s ever encroaching police state, dispensation of freedoms for the illusion of security, and ever-increasing violence by the people sworn to protect and serve the citizenry.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have no falsehoods to defend<br />
  We want the facts;<br />
Our force, our thought, we do not spend<br />
  In vain attacks.<br />
And we will never meanly try<br />
To save some fair and pleasing lie.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The simple truth is what we ask,<br />
  Not the ideal;<br />
We’ve set ourselves the noble task<br />
  To find the real.<br />
If all there is naught but dross,<br />
We want to know and bear our loss.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We will not willingly be fooled,<br />
  By fables nursed;<br />
Our hearts, by earnest thought, are schooled<br />
  To bear the worst;<br />
And we can stand erect and dare<br />
All things. all facts that really are.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have no God to serve or fear,<br />
  No hell to shun,<br />
No devil with malicious leer.<br />
  When life is done<br />
An endless sleep may close our eyes.<br />
A sleep with neither dreams nor sighs.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have no master on the land –<br />
  No king in air –<br />
Without a manacle we stand,<br />
  Without a prayer,<br />
Without a fear of coming night,<br />
We seek the truth, we love the light.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We do not bow before a guess,<br />
  A vague unknown;<br />
A senseless force we do not bless<br />
  In solemn tone.<br />
When evil comes we do not curse,<br />
Or thank because it is no worse.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When cyclones rend – when lightning blights,<br />
  ‘Tis naught but fate;<br />
There is no God of wrath who smites<br />
  In heartless hate.<br />
Behind the things that injure man<br />
There is no purpose, thought, or plan.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We waste no time in useless dread,<br />
  In trembling fear;<br />
The present lives, the past is dead,<br />
  And we are here,<br />
All welcome guests at life’s great feast –<br />
We need no help from ghost or priest.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our life is joyous, jocund, free –<br />
  Not one a slave<br />
Who bends in fear the trembling knee,<br />
  And seeks to save<br />
A coward soul from future pain;<br />
Not one will cringe or crawl for gain.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The jeweled cup of love we drain,<br />
  And friendship’s wine<br />
Now swiftly flows in every vein<br />
  With warmth divine.<br />
And so we love and hope and dream<br />
That in death’s sky there is a gleam.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We walk according to our light,<br />
  Pursue the path<br />
That leads to honor’s stainless height,<br />
  Careless of wrath<br />
Or curse of God, or priestly spite,<br />
Longing to know and do the right.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We love our fellow-man, our kind,<br />
  Wife, child, and friend.<br />
To phantoms we are deaf and blind,<br />
  But we extend<br />
The helping hand to the distressed;<br />
By lifting others we are blessed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Love’s sacred flame within the heart<br />
  And friendship’s glow;<br />
While all the miracles of art<br />
  Their wealth bestow<br />
Upon the thrilled and joyous brain,<br />
And present raptures banish pain.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We love no phantoms of the skies,<br />
  But living flesh,<br />
With passion’s soft and soulful eyes,<br />
  Lips warm and fresh,<br />
And cheeks with health’s red flag unfurled,<br />
The breathing angels of this world.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The hands that help are better far<br />
  Than lips that pray.<br />
Love is the ever gleaming star<br />
  That leads the way,<br />
That shines, not on vague worlds of bliss,<br />
But on a paradise in this.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We do not pray, or weep, or wail;<br />
  We have no dread,<br />
No fear to pass beyond the veil<br />
  That hides the dead.<br />
And yet we question, dream, and guess,<br />
But knowledge we do not possess.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We ask, yet nothing seems to know;<br />
  We cry in vain.<br />
There is no “master of the show”<br />
  Who will explain,<br />
Or from the future tear the mask;<br />
And yet we dream, and still we ask</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there beyond the silent night<br />
  An endless day;<br />
Is death a door that leads to light?<br />
  We cannot say.<br />
The tongueless secret locked in fate<br />
We do not know. – We hope and wait.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Poetry: Self Evident, by Ani DeFranco</h1>
Feb 24, 2008


</header>

<p>A poem by Ani DiFranco, inspired by the events of 9/11.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>yes,<br />
us people are just poems<br />
we’re 90% metaphor<br />
with a leanness of meaning<br />
approaching hyper-distillation<br />
and once upon a time<br />
we were moonshine<br />
rushing down the throat of a giraffe<br />
yes, rushing down the long hallway<br />
despite what the p.a. announcement says<br />
yes, rushing down the long hall<br />
down the long stairs<br />
in a building so tall<br />
that it will always be there<br />
yes, it’s part of a pair<br />
there on the bow of noah’s ark<br />
the most prestigious couple<br />
just kickin back parked<br />
against a perfectly blue sky<br />
on a morning beatific<br />
in its indian summer breeze<br />
on the day that america<br />
fell to its knees<br />
after strutting around for a century<br />
without saying thank you<br />
or please</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>and the shock was subsonic<br />
and the smoke was deafening<br />
between the setup and the punch line<br />
cuz we were all on time for work that day<br />
we all boarded that plane for to fly<br />
and then while the fires were raging<br />
we all climbed up on the window sill<br />
and then we all held hands<br />
and jumped into the sky</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>and every borough looked up when it heard the first blast<br />
and then every dumb action movie was summarily surpassed<br />
and the exodus uptown by foot and motorcar<br />
looked more like war than anything i’ve seen so far<br />
so far<br />
so far<br />
so fierce and ingenious<br />
a poetic specter so far gone<br />
that every jackass newscaster was struck dumb and stumbling<br />
over ‘oh my god’ and ‘this is unbelievable’ and on and on<br />
and i’ll tell you what, while we’re at it<br />
you can keep the pentagon<br />
keep the propaganda<br />
keep each and every tv<br />
that’s been trying to convince me<br />
to participate<br />
in some prep school punk’s plan to perpetuate retribution<br />
perpetuate retribution<br />
even as the blue toxic smoke of our lesson in retribution<br />
is still hanging in the air<br />
and there’s ash on our shoes<br />
and there’s ash in our hair<br />
and there’s a fine silt on every mantle<br />
from hell’s kitchen to brooklyn<br />
and the streets are full of stories<br />
sudden twists and near misses<br />
and soon every open bar is crammed to the rafters<br />
with tales of narrowly averted disasters<br />
and the whiskey is flowin<br />
like never before<br />
as all over the country<br />
folks just shake their heads<br />
and pour</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>so here’s a toast to all the folks that live in palestine, afghanistan,<br />
iraq, el salvador</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>here’s a toast to the folks living on the pine ridge reservation<br />
under the stone cold gaze of mt. rushmore</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>here’s a toast to all those nurses and doctors<br />
who daily provide women with a choice<br />
who stand down a threat the size of oklahoma city<br />
just to listen to a young woman’s voice</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>here’s a toast to all the folks on death row right now<br />
awaiting the executioner’s guillotine<br />
who are shackled there with dread and can only escape into their heads<br />
to find peace in the form of a dream, peace in the form of a dream</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>cuz take away our playstations<br />
and we are a third world nation<br />
under the thumb of some blue blood royal son<br />
who stole the oval office and that phony election<br />
i mean<br />
it don’t take a weatherman<br />
to look around and see the weather<br />
jeb said he’d deliver florida, folks<br />
and boy did he ever</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>and we hold these truths to be self evident:<br />
#1 george w. bush is not president<br />
#2 america is not a true democracy<br />
#3 the media is not fooling me<br />
cuz i am a poem heeding hyper-distillation<br />
i’ve got no room for a lie so verbose<br />
i’m looking out over my whole human family<br />
and i’m raising my glass in a toast</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>here’s to our last drink of fossil fuels<br />
may we vow to get off of this sauce<br />
shoo away the swarms of commuter planes<br />
and find that train ticket we lost<br />
cuz once upon a time the line followed the river<br />
and peeked into all the backyards<br />
and the laundry was waving<br />
the graffiti was teasing us<br />
from brick walls and bridges<br />
we were rolling over ridges<br />
through valleys<br />
under stars<br />
i dream of touring like duke ellington<br />
in my own railroad car<br />
i dream of waiting on the tall blonde wooden benches<br />
in a grand station aglow with grace<br />
and then standing out on the platform<br />
and feeling the air on my face</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>give back the night its distant whistle<br />
give the darkness back its soul<br />
give the big oil companies the finger finally<br />
and relearn how to rock-n-roll<br />
yes, the lessons are all around us and the truth is waiting there<br />
so it’s time to pick through the rubble, clean the streets<br />
and clear the air<br />
get our government to pull its big dick out of the sand<br />
of someone else’s desert<br />
put it back in its pants<br />
and quit the hypocritical chants of<br />
freedom forever</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>cuz when one lone phone rang<br />
in two thousand and one<br />
at ten after nine<br />
on nine one one<br />
which is the number we all called<br />
when that lone phone rang right off the wall<br />
right off our desk and down the long hall<br />
down the long stairs<br />
in a building so tall<br />
that the whole world turned<br />
just to watch it fall</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>and while we’re at it<br />
remember the first time around?<br />
the bomb?<br />
the ryder truck?<br />
the parking garage?<br />
the princess that didn’t even feel the pea?<br />
remember joking around in our apartment on avenue D?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>can you imagine how many paper coffee cups would have to change their design<br />
following a fantastical reversal of the new york skyline?!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>it was a joke<br />
at the time<br />
and that was just a few years ago<br />
so let the record show<br />
that the FBI was all over that case<br />
that the plot was obvious and in everybody’s face<br />
and scoping that scene<br />
religiously<br />
the CIA<br />
or is it KGB?<br />
committing countless crimes against humanity<br />
with this kind of eventuality<br />
as its excuse<br />
for abuse after expensive abuse<br />
and it didn’t have a clue<br />
look, another window to see through<br />
way up here<br />
on the 104th floor<br />
look<br />
another key<br />
another door<br />
10% literal<br />
90% metaphor<br />
3000 some poems disguised as people<br />
on an almost too perfect day<br />
must be more than pawns<br />
in some asshole’s passion play<br />
so now it’s your job<br />
and it’s my job<br />
to make it that way<br />
to make sure they didn’t die in vain<br />
sshhhhhh….<br />
baby listen<br />
hear the train?</p>

<h1>Suicide Bombing in Medina, Saudi Arabia</h1>
Jul 4, 2016


</header>

<p>Another act of terror and violence today. This attack was on the Holy Mosque in Medina, Saudi Arabia.</p>

<h1 id="medina-explosion-suicide-bombing-near-saudi-holy-site">Medina explosion: Suicide bombing near Saudi holy site</h1>

<ul>
  <li>5 July 2016</li>
</ul>

<p>The attack occurred soon
after sundown at during the holy month of Ramadan
A suicide bomber has killed four security officers and injured five
others near one of Islam’s holiest sites in the Saudi city of Medina,
according to the interior ministry.</p>

<p>The bomber detonated his explosives after being stopped outside the
Prophet’s Mosque, a statement said.</p>

<p>The mosque is the burial place of the Prophet Muhammad and Medina the
second-holiest city in Islam after Mecca.</p>

<p>Suicide blasts also struck two other Saudi cities on Monday.</p>

<p>That an attack happened in Medina at such a place is likely to leave
Muslims around the world aghast, BBC World Service’s Middle East editor,
Alan Johnston, says.</p>

<p>Suspicion is likely to fall on so-called Islamic State (IS), he adds.</p>

<p><a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2016/07/04/Fresh-bombings-in-two-Saudi-cities-after-earlier-blast-.html">Al-Arabiya</a>
gave a different account of the incident, saying the bomber had targeted
the security officers by pretending he wanted to break his Ramadan fast
with them.</p>

<p>Qari Ziyaad Patel, 36, from South Africa, who was in the mosque, told
the Associated Press news agency people had at first thought it was the
sound of the cannon fire that marks the breaking of fast.</p>

<p>The ground shook, he said, adding: “The vibrations were very strong. It
sounded like a building imploded.”</p>

<p>The site is one of Islam’s holiest &lt;/span&gt;
Earlier, at least one explosion rocked Qatif, an eastern city which is
home to many minority Shia Muslims.</p>

<p>The blast appeared to target a Shia mosque. The attacker was killed but
no other casualties were reported.</p>

<p>A suspected suicide bomber <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-36700635">also died after detonating a device near the
US consulate in the city of
Jeddah</a>. Two
security officers were slightly injured as they tackled the man, but
no-one else was hurt.</p>

<p>No-one has yet said they were behind any of the attacks.</p>

<p>They come with the holy month of Ramadan drawing to a close and ahead of
the Eid al-Fitr holiday.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia has been the target of attacks by IS over the past two
years.</p>

<p>In June, the interior ministry said there had been 26 “terror attacks”
in the kingdom in that time.</p>

<p>A series of deadly attacks worldwide were either claimed by, or blamed
on, IS over the past week:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36658187">A suicide gun and bomb attack targeted Istanbul airport on 28
June</a>, killing 45
people.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-36692613">Attackers struck a cafe in Bangladesh’s capital, Dhaka, last Friday
night</a>. Twenty
hostages and two policemen were killed.</li>
  <li>A massive <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-36701882">truck bomb in Iraq’s capital,
Baghdad,</a> on
Sunday left at least 165 people dead.</li>
</ul>
